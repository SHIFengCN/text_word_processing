"A PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER:'* 

Beth Harmon was a child, 
struggling 
in a cold and terrifying 
world 
of caretakers 
and institutions, 
when she discovered 
her gift...and 
the elegant, 
deadly game, difficult 
for some, but strangely 
easy for 
her. It gave her strength

AuTHOR'S NoTE 

The superb chess of Grandmasters Robert 
Fischer, 
Boris 
Spassky 
and Anatoly 
Karpov has been a source of delight 
to players 
like myself for years. Since The Queen' s Gambit 
is a work of fiction, 
however, 
it seemed prudent 
to omit 
them from the cast of characters, if only to prevent 
contraÂ­
diction 
of the record. 
I would like to express 
my thanks to Joe Ancrile, 
FairÂ­
field Hoban and Stuart Morden, all excellent 
players
, who 
helped me with books, magazines 
and tournament 
rules. 
And I was fortunate 
to have the warm-hearted and diliÂ­
gent help of 
National 
Master Bruce Pandolfini 
in proofÂ­
reading the text and helping 
me rid 
it of errors 
concerning 
the game 
he plays so enviably 
well . 

CHAPTER 1 

Beth learned of her mother's death from a woman 
with a 
clipboard. The next day her picture appeared 
in the HeraldÂ­
Leader. The photogra
ph, taken on the porch of the gray 
house on Maplewood 
Drive, showed Beth in 
a simple 
cotton 
frock. Even then, she was clearly 
plain. 
A legend 
under the picture read: "Orphaned by yesterday' s pile-up 
on New Circle 
Road, Elizabeth Hannon surveys 
a troubled 
future. Elizabeth, 
eight, 
was left without 
family by the 
crash, which killed 
two and injured others. At home alone 
at the time, 
Elizabeth 
learned of the accident shortly before 
the photo was taken. She will be well looked after, authorÂ­
ities 
say . " 

In the Methuen 
Home i n Mount Sterling, Kentucky, Beth 
was given a tranquilizer twice a day . 
So were all the other 
children, 
to "even their dispositions
. " Beth's disposition 

WALTER TEVIS 

was all right
, as far as anyone could see, but she was glad 
to get the little 
pill. It loosened 
something 
deep in her 
stomach 
and helped her 
doze away the tense hours in the 
orphanage
. 
Mr. Fergussen gave 
them the pills 
in a little paper cup. 
Along with the green one that evened the disposit
ion, there 
were orange and brown ones for building 
a strong 
body. 
The childrï¿½n had to line up to get them. 
The tallest 
girl was the 
black one, Jolene. 
She was 
twelve. 
On her second day 
Beth stood behind her 
in 
Vitamin Line, and Jolene turned to look down 
at her, 
scowling. 
"You a real orphan or a bastard
?" 
Beth did not know what to say. She was frightened. 
They were at the back of the line, 
and she was supposed 
to 
stand there until they got 
up to the window where Mr. 
Fergussen 
stood. 
Beth had 
heard her mother call her father 
a bastard, but she didn't know what it meant. 
"What's your name, girl?" 
Jolene 
asked. 
"Beth." 
"Your mother dead? What 
about your daddy?" 
Beth stared 
at her. The words 
"mother" 
and "dead" 
were unbearab
le. She wanted to run, but there was no 
place to run to. 
"Your folks, " Jolene said in a voice that was not 
unsympathetic, "they dead?" 
Beth could find nothing 
to say or do. She stood in line 
terrified, waiting 
for the pills. 

"You're all greedy cocksuck
ers! " It was Ralph in the 
Boys' Ward who shouted that. She heard it because she 
was in the 
library and it had a window facing Boys'. 
She had no mental image for 
"cocksuck
er," and the word 

2 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

was strange. But she knew from the sound of it they 
would 
wash his mouth out with soap. They'd done it to her for 
"damn"-and Mother had said " Damn" all 
the time. 

The barber made her sit absolutely 
still 
in the chair. 
"If 
you move, you might just lose an ear . " There was nothing 
jovial 
in his 
voice. Beth sat as quietly 
as she could, but it 
was impossible 
to keep completely 
stil l . It took him a very 
long time to cut her hair into 
the bangs they all 
wore. She 
tried to occupy herself 
by thinking 
of that word, "cockÂ­
sucker. " All she could picture was a bird , like a woodÂ­
pecker. 
But she felt that was wrong. 

The janitor was fatter 
on one side than 
on the other. 
His 
name was Shaibel. Mr. Shaibel. One day she was sent to 
the basement 
to clean the blackboard 
erasers 
by clomping 
them together, 
and she found him sitting 
on a metal stool 
near the furnace scowling 
over a green-and-white checkerÂ­
board in front of him. But where the checkers 
should be 
there were little 
plastic 
things 
in funny shapes. Some were 
larger 
than others. There were more of the small ones than 
any of the others. The janitor looked up at her. She left in 
silence. 
On Friday, everybody 
ate fish, Catholic 
or not. It came 
in squares, breaded with 
a dark, brown, dry crust and 
covered 
with a thick orange sauce, like bottled 
French 
dressing. The sauce was sweet and 
terrible, but the fish 
beneath 
it was worse. The taste of it nearly 
gagged her. 
But you had to eat every bite, or Mrs. Deardorff 
would be 
told about you and you wouldn' t get adopted. 
Some children got adopted 
right off. A six-year-old 
named Alice had come in a month after Beth and was 

3 

WALTER TEVIS 

taken in three weeks by some nice-looking 
people 
with an 
accent. They walked 
through 
the ward on the day they 
came for Alice. Beth had wanted to throw her arms 
around 
them because 
they looked happy to her, but she turned 
away when they glanced 
at her. Other children 
had been 
there a long time and knew they would never 
leave. They 
called 
themselves 
" lifers. " Beth wondered 
if she was a 
lifer. 

Gym was bad, and volleyball 
was the worst. 
Beth could 
never hit the ball right. 
She would slap at it fiercely 
or 
push at it with stiff fingers
. Once she hurt her 
finger 
so 
much that 
it swelled 
up afterward. Most of the girls 
laughed 
and shouted 
when they played, but Beth never did. 
Jolene 
was the best player by 
far. It wasn't just that she 
was older and taller; 
she always knew exactly 
what to do, 
and when 
the ball came high over the net, she 
could 
station 
herself 
under it without 
having to shout at the 
others to keep 
out of her way, and then leap 
ï¿½p and spike 
it down with 
a long, smooth movement 
of her arm. The 
team that 
had Jolene 
always won. 
The week after Beth hurt her finger, 
Jolene 
stopped 
her 
when gym ended and the others 
were rushing 
back to the 
showers. "Lemme show you something
, " Jolene said. 
She held her hands up with the long fingers 
open and 
slightly 
flexed. " You do it like this. " She bent her elbows 
and pushed her hands up smoothly, cupping 
an imaginary 
bal l . "Try it. " 
Beth tried it, awkwardly 
at fir
st. Jolene showed her 
again, laughing
. Beth tried a few more times and did it 
better. Then 
Jolene 
got the ball and had Beth catch it with 
her fingertips. After a few times it got to be easy. 

4 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

"You work on that now, hear?" Jolene 
said and ran 
off 
to the shower. 
Beth worked on it over the next week, and after that she 
did not mind volleyball 
at all . She did 
not become good at 
it, but it wasn' t something 
she was afraid of anymore. 

Every Tuesday, Miss Graham sent Beth down after 
ArithÂ­
metic to do the erasers
. It was considered 
a privilege, 
and 
Beth was the best student 
in the class, even though she 
was the youngest. She did not like the basement. 
It smelled 
musty, 
and she was afraid of Mr. Shaibel
. But she wanted 
to know more about the 
game he played 
on that board by 
himself. 
One day 
she went over 
and stood near him, waiting 
for 
him to move a piece. The one he 
was touching 
was the one 
with a horse' s head on a little 
pedestal. After a second he 
looked up at her with a frown of irritation
. " What do you 
want, child?" he said. 
Normally 
she fled from any human encounter, 
espeÂ­
cially with 
grownups , but this time she did not back away. 
"What's that game called?" 
she asked. 
He stared at her. "You should be upstairs 
with the 
others.' ' 
She looked at him levelly; 
something 
about this man and 
the steadiness 
with which he 
played his mysterious 
game 
helped her to hold tightly 
to what she 
wanted. "I don' t 
want to b e with the others, " she said. " I want to know 
what game you're playing. " 
He looked at her more closely. Then he shrugged. "It's 
called 
chess. ' ' 

A bare light bulb hung from a black cord between 
Mr. 

5 

WALTER TEVIS 

Shaibel 
and the furnace. Beth was careful not to let the 
shadow of her head fall 
on the board. It was Sunday 
morning. 
They were having chapel 
upstairs in the library, 
and she had held up her hand for permission 
to go to the 
bathroom 
and then come down 
here. She had been standÂ­
Â· the janitor 
ing, watching
play chess, 
for ten minutes. 
Neither 
of them had spoken, 
but he seemed to accept 
her 
presence. 
He would stare at the pieces for minutes 
at a time, 
motionless, looking 
at them as though he hated them, and 
then reach 
out over his belly, pick one up by its top with 
his fingert
ips, hold it for a moment as though holding 
a 
dead mouse by the tail and set it on another 
square. He 
did not 
look up at Beth. 
Beth stood with the black shadow 
of her head on the 
concrete 
floor at her feet and watched 
the board, not 
taking 
her eyes from it, watching 
every move. 

She had learned to save her tranquilizers until night. 
That 
helped her sleep. 
She would put the oblong pill in her 
mouth when Mr. Fergus 
sen handed it to her, get it under 
her tongue, take a sip of the canned orange juice that 
came with the pill, swallow, 
and then when 
Mr. Fergussen 
had gone on to the next child, take the pill 
from her 
mouth and 
slip it 
into the pocket 
of her middy blouse. 
The 
pill had a hard coating 
and did not 
soften 
in the time it sat 
under her tongue. 
For the 
first two months she had slept very little
. She 
tried to, lying still 
with her eyes tightly 
shut. But she 
would hear the girls 
in the other 
beds cough or tum or 
mutter, 
or a night orderly 
would walk down the corridor 
and the shadow would 
cross her bed and she would see it, 

6 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

even with her eyes closed. 
A distant 
phone would ring, or 
a toilet would 
flush. 
But worst of all was when she heard 
voices 
talking 
at the desk at the end of the corridor
. No 
matter 
how softly the orderly 
spoke to the night attendan
t, 
no matter 
how pleasantly
, Beth immediately 
found herself 
tense and 
fully awake. Her stomach 
contracted
, she tasted 
vinegar 
in her 
mouth; and sleep would be out of the 
question 
for that night. 
Now she would snuggle 
up in bed, allowing 
herself to 
feel the tension 
in her stomach 
with a thrill, knowing 
it 
would soon leave her. She waited 
there in the dark, alone, 
monitoring 
herself, 
waiting 
for the turmoil 
in her to peak. 
Then she swallowed the two pills 
and lay back until the 
ease began to 
spread 
through 
her body 
like the waves of a 
warm sea. 

" Will you teach me?" 
Mr. Shaibel said nothing, 
did not even register 
the 
question 
with a movement 
of his head. 
Distant 
voices 
from 
above were singing 
"Bringing 
in the 
Sheaves. " 
She waited for several 
minutes. Her voice almost 
broke 
with the effort 
of her 
words, but she pushed them out, 
anyway: 
"I want to learn 
to play 
chess. " 
Mr. Shaibel 
reached 
out a fat hand to 
one of the larger 
black pieces, picked it up deftly 
by its head and set 
it 
down on a square at the other side of 
the board. He 
brought 
the hand back and folded his arms across his 
chest. 
He still did not 
look at Beth. "I don't play strangers
. " 
The flat voice had the effect of a slap in the face. Beth 
turned and left, walking 
upstairs 
with the bad taste in her 
mouth. 
' 'I'm not a stranger
," she said to 
him two days 
later. 
" I 

7 

WALTER TEVIS 

live here . ' ' Behind her head a small moth circled 
the bare 
bulb, and its pale 
shadow crossed 
the board at regular 
interval
s . " You can teach me
. I already 
know some of it, 
from watching
. " 
"Girls 
don' t play chess. " Mr. Shaibel's voice was 
flat. 
She steeled 
herself 
and took a step closer, 
pointing 
at, 
but not touching, one of the cylindrical 
pieces 
that she had 
already 
labeled 
a cannon in her imagination
. "This one 
moves up and down 
or back and 
forth. All the way, if 
there' s space to move in. " 
Mr. Shaibel 
was silent 
for a while. 
Then he pointed 
at 
the one 
with what looked like a slashed 
lemon on top. 
" And this one?" 
Her heart leapt. 
"On the diagonals. " 

You could save up pills 
by taking 
only one at night and 
keeping the other. Beth put the 
extras 
in her toothbrush 
holder, 
where nobody would ever look. She just had to 
make sure to 
dry the toothbrush 
as much as she could 
with 
a paper towel after she used it, or else not use it at all and 
rub her teeth clean with a finger. 
That night for the first 
time she took three pills, one 
after the other. Little 
prickles 
went across 
the hairs on the 
back of her 
neck; she had discovered something 
important
. 
She let 
the glow spread 
all over her, lying on her cot in her 
faded blue pajamas in the worst place in the Girls' 
Ward, 
near the door to the corridor 
and across from 
the bathÂ­
room. Something 
in her life was solved: 
she knew about 
the chess pieces 
and how they moved and captured, 
and 
she knew how to make herself 
feel good in the stomach 
and in the 
tense joints 
of her arms and legs, with the 
pills 
the orphanage 
gave her.

"Okay, child, " Mr. Shaibel 
said. " We can play chess 
now. I play White.' ' 
She had the erasers
. It was after Arithmet
ic, and GeogÂ­
raphy was in ten minutes. 
"I don' t have much time , " she 
said. She 
had learned all the moves last 
Sunday, during the 
hour that chapel allowed 
her to be in the basement. 
No one 
ever missed her 
at chap
el, as long as she 
checked 
in, 
because 
of the group of girls that came from Children
' s , 
across 
town. But Geography 
was different. She was terriÂ­
fied of Mr. Schell, even though she 
was at the top 
of the 
class. 
The janitor's voice was flat. "Now or never," he 
said. 
' ' I have Geography 
. . . ' ' 
"Now or never." 
She thought 
only a second before 
deciding. 
She had 
seen an 
old milk crate behind the furnace. She dragged it 
to the other end of the board, seated herself 
and said, 
' ' Move.' ' 
He beat her with 
what she was to learn later was called 
the Scholar ' s Mate, after four moves. It was quick, but not 
quick enough to keep her 
from being fifteen minutes 
late 
for Geography. She said she'd been in the bathroom . 
Mr. Schell 
stood at the desk with his hands o n his hips. 
He surveyed 
the class. 
" Have any 
of you young ladies 
seen this young lady in the ladies' ? " 
There were subdued 
giggles
. N o hands were raised, not 
even Jolene' s , although 
Beth had lied for her twice. 
' ' And how many of you ladies 
were in the ladies' 
before 
class?" 
There were more giggles 
and three hands.

WALTER TEVIS 

" And did 
any of you see Beth there? 
Washing 
her pretty 
little 
hands, perhaps?" 
There was no response. Mr. Schell 
turned back to the 
board, where he had been listing 
the exports 
of Argentina, 
and added the 
word " silver." For a moment Beth thought 
it was done with. But 
then he spoke, with his back to the 
class. "Five demerits
, " he said. 
With ten demerits 
you were whipped 
on the behind with 
a leather strap. Beth had felt that strap only in her imaginaÂ­
tion, but her imagination 
expanded for 
a moment with a 
vision 
of pain like 
fire on the soft parts of herself. 
She put 
a hand to her heart, 
feeling in the bottom 
of the breast 
pocket of her blouse for that morning' s pill. The fear 
reduced 
itself 
perceptibly. She visualized 
her toothbrush 
holder, 
the long rectangula
r plastic 
container; 
it had four 
more pills 
in it now, there in the drawer of the 
little 
metal 
stand by her 
cot. 
That night 
she lay on her 
back in bed. She had not yet 
taken the pill in her hand. She listened 
to the night 
noises 
and noticed 
how they seemed to get louder 
as her eyes 
grew accustomed 
to the darkness. Down the hallway 
Mr. 
Byrne began talking 
to Mrs. Holland, 
at the desk. 
Beth' s 
body grew taut at the sound. She blinked 
and looked 
at the 
dark ceiling 
overhead 
and forced herself 
to see the chess
board with its green and white squares. Then she 
put the 
pieces on her home 
squares: rook, knight, 
bishop, queen, 
king, and the row 
of pawns in front of them. Then she 
moved White's king pawn up to the fourth row. She 
pushed Black's up. She could do this! It was simple. 
She went on, beginning 
to replay 
the game she had lost. 
She brought Mr. 
Shaibel' s knight up 
to the third row. It 

lO 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

stood there clearly 
in her mind 
on the green-and-white 
board on the ceiling 
of the ward. 
The noises 
had already 
faded into a 
white, 
harmonious 
background. Beth lay happily 
in bed, playing chess. 

The next Sunday she blocked 
the Scholar's 
Mate with her 
king's knight. 
She had gone over 
the game in her mind a 
hundred times, until the anger and humilia
tion were purged 
from it, leaving 
the pieces and the board clear in 
her 
nighttime 
vision. When she came to play Mr. 
Shaibel 
on 
Sunday, 
it was all worked out, and she 
moved the 
knight 
as if in a dream. She loved the feel of the piece, the 
miniatur
e horse's head in her hand . When she set down the 
knight 
on the square, the janitor scowled 
at it. He took his 
queen by 
the head and checked 
Beth's king with it. But 
Beth was ready for that too; she had seen it in bed the 
night before. 
It took him 
fourteen 
moves to 
trap her queen. She tried 
to play on, queenless, 
to ignore the mortal loss, but he 
reached 
out and stopped 
her hand from touching 
the pawn 
she was about to 
move. " You resign 
now, " he said
. His 
voice was 
rough. 
"Resign?" 
"That's 
right, 
child. When you lose the 
queen that way, 
you resign
. ' ' 
She stared 
at him, not comprehending. He let go o f her 
hand, picked 
up her black 
king, and set it on its side on the 
board. It rolled 
back and forth for a moment and then lay 
still. 
''No,' ' she said. 
"Yes. You have resigned 
the game . " 

1 1 

WALTER TEVIS 

She wanted to hit him with something. " You didn't tell 
me that in 
the rules.'' 
"It's 
not a rule. It's sportsmansh
ip. " 
She knew now what he meant, but she 
did not like it. ' 'I 
want to finish, " she said. She picked 
up the king and set it 
back on its square. 
" No . " 
" You've got to finish
, " she said. 
He raised 
his eyebrows 
and got up. She had never 
seen 
him stand in the basement-only 
out in the halls when he 
was sweeping or 
in the classrooms 
when he washed 
the 
blackboar
ds. He had to stoop a bit now to keep his head 
from hitting 
the rafters 
on the low ceiling. 
' 'No, ' ' he said. 
" You lost." 
It wasn't fair. She had no interest 
in sportsman
ship. She 
wanted to play and to win. She wanted to win more than 
she had ever wanted anything. She said a word she had not 
said since her 
mother died: "Please. " 
"Game' s over , " he said. 
She stared 
at him in 
fury. " You greedy . 
He let his 
arms drop straight 
at his sides 
and said 
slowly, "No more chess. Get out." 
If only she were bigger. 
But she wasn't. She got up 
from the board and walked to the stairs 
while the janitor 
watched 
her in silence. 

On Tuesday 
when she went down the hall to the basement 
door carrying the erasers
, she found that the door was 
locked. She pushed against 
it twice with her hip, but it 
wouldn't budge. She knocked, 
softly 
at first and then 
loudly, but there was no sound from the other side. It was 
horrible. She knew he was in there sitting 
at the board, 

1 2 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

that he was just being angry at her from the last time, but 
there was nothing 
she could do about it. When she brought 
back the erasers
, Miss Graham 
didn' t even notice 
they 
hadn' t been cleaned 
or that Beth was back sooner than 
usual. 
On Thursday 
she was certain it 
would be the same, but 
it wasn't. The door was open, and when 
she went down 
the stairs, 
Mr. Shaibel 
acted as though nothing 
had hapÂ­
pened. The pieces 
were set up. She cleaned the 
erasers 
huniedly 
and seated 
herself 
at the board. Mr. Shaibel 
had 
moved his king's pawn by the time she got there. She 
played her king's pawn, moving it two squares 
forward. 
She would not make any mistakes 
this time. 
He responded 
to her move quickly, 
and she immediately 
replied. They said nothing 
to each 
other, 
but kept moving. 
Beth could feel the tension, 
and she liked it. 
On the twentieth 
move Mr. Shaibel 
advanced 
a knight 
when he shouldn't 
have and Beth was able to get a pawn 
to the sixth rank. He brought 
the knight 
back. It was a 
wasted move and she felt a thrill 
when she saw him 
do it. 
She traded 
her bishop for the knight. 
Then, on the next 
move, she pushed the pawn again. It would become a 
queen on the next move. 
He looked 
at it sitting 
there and then reached out 
angrily 
and toppled 
his king. Neither 
of them said anything. It was 
her first win. All 
of the tension 
was gone, and what Beth 
felt inside 
herself 
was as wonderful as anything 
she had 
ever felt in 
her life. 

She found 
she could miss lunch on Sundays, and no one 
paid any attention. That gave her 
three hours with Mr. 
Shaibel, until he left for home at two-thirt
y . They did not 

13 

WALTER TEVIS 

talk, either 
of them. He always played the white pieces, 
moving first, and she 
the black. 
She had thought 
about 
questioning 
this but decided 
not to. 
One Sunday, after a game he had barely managed to 
win, he said to her, " You should learn the Sicilian 
Defense . " 
" What's that?" 
she asked irritably
. 
She was 
still 
smarting 
from the loss. She had beaten 
him 
two games last week. 
" When White moves pawn to king four, Black does 
this. " He reached down 
and moved the white pawn two 
squares 
up the board, his almost invariable first 
move. 
Then he picked 
up the pawn in front of the black 
queen's 
bishop 
and set it down two squares up toward the middle. 
It was the first time he had ever shown her 
anything 
like 
this. 
"Then what?" she said. 
He picked 
up the king's knight 
and set it below and to 
the right of the pawn. " Knight to KB-3." 
" What's KB-3?" 
" King's bishop 
three. Where I just put the knight. " 
' 'The squares have names? ' ' 
H e nodded impassive
ly. She sensed 
that h e was unwillÂ­
ing to give up even this 
much information. 
" If you play 
well, they have 
names. " 
She leaned 
forward. " Show me. " 
H e looked down a t her. "No. Not now. " 
This infuriated 
her. She understood 
well enough that a 
person likes to keep his secrets. She kept hers. NevertheÂ­
less, 
she wanted to lean across 
the board 
and slap his face 
and make him tell her. She sucked 
in her breath. "Is that 
the Sicilian 
Defense?" 

1 4 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

He seemed relieved that 
she had dropped the subject 
of 
the names of the squares. "There's 
more , " he said. He 
went on with it, showing 
her the basic 
moves and some 
variations. But he did not use the 
names of the squares. He 
showed her the Levenfish 
Variation 
and the Najdorf VariaÂ­
tion and told her to go over them. She 
did, without 
a 
single 
mistake. 
But when they played a real game afterward, he pushed 
his queen's pawn forward, and she could see immediately 
that what he had just taught 
her was useless 
in this situaÂ­
tion. She glared at him across 
the board, feeling that if she 
had had a 
knife, she 
could have stabbed 
him with it. Then 
she looked back 
to the board and moved her 
own queen' s 
pawn forward, determined 
to beat him. 
He moved the 
pawn next to his queen's pawn, the one 
in front of the bishop. He often did 
this. " Is that 
one of 
those things? 
Like the Sicilian 
Defense?" she asked. 
"Openings. " He did not look at her; he was watching 
the board. 
" Is it?" 
He shrugged
. "The Queen's Gambit. " 
She felt better. She had learned something 
more from 
him. She decided 
not to take the offered pawn, to leave the 
tension 
on the board. She liked it like that. 
She liked the 
power of the pieces, 
exerted 
along files and 
diagonals. In 
the middle of the game, when pieces 
were everywhere
, the 
forces crisscrossing 
the board thrilled 
her. She brought 
out 
her king' s knight, 
feeling its power 
spread . 
In twenty moves she had 
won both his 
rooks, and he 
resigned
. 

She rolled 
over in bed, put a 
pillow 
over her head to block 

1 5 

WALTER TEVIS 

out the light from under the corridor door 
and began to 
think how 
you could use a bishop and a rook together 
to 
make a sudden check on the king. If you moved the 
bishop, the king would be in check, 
and the 
bishop 
would 
be free to do whatever 
it wanted to 
on the next moveÂ­
even take the queen. She lay there for quite a 
while, 
thinking 
excitedly 
of this powerful attack. 
Then she took 
the pillow 
off and rolled 
over on her back and made the 
chessboard 
on the ceiling 
and played over all her 
games 
with Mr. Shaibel, one at a time. She saw two places 
where 
she might have 
created 
the rook-bishop 
situation 
she had 
j ust invented
. In one of them she 
could have forced it by a 
double threat, and in the other she could probably 
have 
sneaked 
it in. She replayed 
those two games in her mind 
with the new moves, and won them both. She 
smiled 
happily 
to herself 
and fell asleep
. 

The Arithmetic 
teacher 
gave the eraser 
cleaning 
to another 
student, 
saying that Beth needed a rest. It wasn't fair, 
because 
Beth still 
had perfect 
grades in Arithmetic, but 
there was nothing 
she could do about it. She sat 
in class 
when the little 
red-haired 
boy went 
out of the room each 
day with the erasers
, doing her meaningless 
additions 
and 
subtractions 
with a trembling 
hand. She wanted to 
play 
chess more desperately 
every day. 
On Tuesday 
and Wednesday 
she took 
only one pill and 
saved the other. 
On Thursday 
she was able to go to sleep 
after playing 
chess in her mind for an hour or so, 
and she 
saved the day's two pills. She did the same thing on 
Friday. All day Saturday
, doing her work in the 
cafeteria 
kitchen 
and in the afternoon during 
the Christian movie 
in 
the library and the Personal 
Improvement 
Talk before 

1 6 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

dinner, 
she could feel a little 
glow whenever 
she wanted 
to, knowing 
that she had six pills 
in her toothbrush 
holder. 
That night, 
after lights 
out, she took them all , one by 
one, and waited. 
The feeling, when it came, was delicious 
-a kind of easy 
sweetness 
in her belly and a loosening 
in 
the tight parts of 
her body. She kept herself 
awake as 
long 
as she could to enjoy the warmth inside her, the 
deep 
chemical 
happines
s . 
On Sunday when Mr. Shaibel 
asked where she had 
been, she was surprised 
that he cared . 
"They wouldn't let 
me out of class, " she said. 
He nodded. 
The chessboa
rd was set 
up, and she saw to 
her surprise 
that the white pieces 
were facing her side and 
that the milk crate was already 
in place. 
"Do I move 
first?" she said, incredulous. 
" Yes. From now on we take turns. It' s the way the 
game should 
be played. ' ' 
She seated herself 
and moved the king's pawn. Mr. 
Shaibel 
wordlessly 
moved his queen bishop's pawn. She 
hadn' t forgotten the moves. She never forgot chess moves. 
He played the Levenfish 
Variation; 
she kept her eyes on 
his bishop' s command of the long diagonal
, the way it was 
waiting 
to pounce. 
And she 
found a way to neutralize 
it on 
the seventeenth 
move. She was able to trade her own, 
weaker bishop 
for it. 
Then she moved in with her knight, 
brought a rook out, and had 
him mated in ten more moves. 
It had been simple-merely a matter 
of keeping her 
eyes 
open and visualizing the ways the game could go. 
The checkmate 
took him by surprise; 
she caught the 
king on the back rank, reaching 
her arm all the way across 
the board and setting 
the rook crisply 
on the mating square. 
"Mate , " she said 
levelly. 

17 

WALTER TEVIS 

Mr. Shaibel 
seemed different today. 
He did not scowl as 
he always did when she 
beat him. 
He leaned 
forward and 
said, "I'll 
teach you chess notation
. " 
She looked up at him. 
"The names of the squares. I'll teach you now. " 
She blinked. 
"Am I good enough 
now?" 
He started 
to say something 
and stopped. " How old are 
you, child?'' 
"Eight." 
"Eight years old . " He leaned forward-as 
far as 
his 
huge paunch would permit. ' 'To tell you the truth of it, 
child, you are astounding
. " 
She did not understand 
what he was saying. 
"Excuse me. " Mr. Shaibel 
reached 
down on the floor 
for a nearly 
empty pint bottle. He tilted his 
head back and 
drank from it. 
"Is that whiskey?" Beth asked. 
" Yes, child. 
And don't tell. " 
" I won't," she said. "Teach me chess notation
. " 
He set the bottle 
back on the floor. 
Beth followed it for 
a moment with her eyes, wondering 
what whiskey 
would 
taste like and what it would feel like when you drank it. 
Then she turned her gaze and her 
attention 
back to 
the 
board with its thirty-two 
pieces, 
each exerting 
its own 
silent 
force. 

Sometime in the middle of the night she was awakened. 
Someone 
was sitting on 
the edge of her bed. She stiffened. 
"Take it easy, " Jolene 
whispered. " It's only me. " 
Beth said nothing, 
just lay there and waited. 
"Thought 
you might 
like trying something 
fun, " Jolene 
said. She 
reached 
a hand under 
the sheet and laid it gently 

1 8 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

on Beth ' s belly. Beth was on her back. The hand stayed 
there, and Beth's body remained 
stiff. 
" Don' t be uptight
, " Jolene 
whispered. " I ain' t gonna 
hurt nothing. " She giggled soft
ly. "I'm just horny. You 
know what it's 
like to be horny?" 
Beth did not 
know. 
" Just relax. I'm just going to rub a little
. It'll feel good, 
if you Jet it.' ' 
Beth turned her head toward the corridor 
door. It was 
shut. The light, 
as usual, came under it. She could hear 
distant 
voices, down at the desk. 
Jolene's hand was moving downward. 
Beth shook her 
head. "Don't . . . " she whispered . 
" Hush now , " Jolene 
said. Her hand moved down 
farÂ­
ther, and one finger began to 
rub up and 
down. It did 
not 
hurt, but something 
in Beth resisted 
it. She felt herself 
perspirin
g. "Ah shit, " Jolene 
said. "I 
bet that feels good . " 
She squirmed a little 
closer 
to Beth and took Beth's hand 
with her free one, pulling 
it toward her. " You touch me, 
too , " she 
said. 
Beth Jet her hand 
go limp. Jolene 
guided 
it up under her 
nightgown 
until the fingers grazed 
a place that felt warm 
and damp. 
"Come on now, press a 
little
, " Jolene 
whispered. 
The 
intensity 
in the whispering 
voice was frightening. Beth did 
as she 
was told and pressed 
harder. 
"Come on, baby, " Jolene 
whispered , "move it up and 
down. Like this. " She started moving 
her finger 
on Beth. 
It was terrifying. Beth 
rubbed Jolene 
a few times, trying 
hard, concentrating 
on just doing it. 
Her face was wet with 
sweat and her free hand was clutching 
at the sheet, squeezÂ­
ing it with all her might. 

1 9 

WALTER TEVIS 

terrified. "No, I don't want 

Then Jolene' s face was against 
hers and her arm around 
Beth ' s chest. 
" Faster , " Jolene 
whispered. "Faster. " 
"No," Beth said aloud, 
to.'' She pulled 
her hand away. 
" Son of a bitch, " Jolene 
said aloud. 
Footsteps 
came running 
up the hallway, 
and the door 
opened. Light streamed 
in. It was one 
of the night people 
whom Beth didn' t know. The lady stood there for 
a minÂ­
ute. Everything 
was quiet. 
Jolene 
was gone. Beth didn
't 
dare move to see if she was back in her own bed. Finally 
the woman left. Beth looked over and saw the 
outline 
of 
Jolene's body back in bed. Beth had three pills in the 
drawer; she 
took all three. Then she lay on her back and 
waited 
for the bad 
taste to 
go away. 
The next day in the cafeteri
a, Beth felt wretched 
from 
not sleeping. 
" You are the 
ugliest 
white girl ever," Jolene 
said, in a 
stage whisper. 
She had come up to Beth in the line for the 
little 
boxes of cereal. " Your nose is ugly 
and your face is 
ugly and your skin 
is like sandpaper. 
You white 
trash 
cracker 
bitch.' ' 
Jolene 
went on, head high, to the scrambled 
eggs. 
Beth said nothing, 
knowing that 
it was true. 

King, knight, 
pawn. The tensions 
on the board were enough 
to warp it. Then whack! Down came the queen. Rooks at 
the bottom of the board, hemmed in at first, but ready, 
building 
pressure 
and then removing 
the pressure 
in a 
single 
move. In General 
Science, 
Miss Hadley had spoken 
of magnets, 
of " lines of force. " Beth, nearly asleep 
with 
boredom, had waked 
up suddenly. Lines of force: bishops 
on diagonal
s; rooks on files.

The seats 
in a classroom could be like the squares. If the 
red-haired boy named 
Ralph were a knight, 
she could pick 
him up and move 
him two seats up and 
one over, setting 
him on the empty seat next to Denise. 
This would check 
Bertrand, 
who sat 
in the front row and 
was, she decided, 
the king. She smiled, 
thinking 
of it. Jolene 
and she had not 
spoken for over a week, and Beth had not let herself cry. 
She was almost 
nine years old, and she didn't need Jolene
. 
It didn
't matter how she felt about it. She didn' t need 
Jolene. 

" Here , " Mr. Shaibel 
said. He handed her something 
in a 
brown paper bag. It was noon on Sunday. She slipped 
the 
bag open. In it was a heavy paperback 
book- Modern 

Chess Openings. 

Incredulously, 
she began to tum the pages. It was filled 
with long vertical 
columns 
of chess notatio
ns. There were 
little 
chessboard diagrams 
and chapter 
heads like "Queen' s 
Pawn Openings" 
and " Indian Defense 
Systems. " She 
looked up. 
He was scowling 
at her. "It's the best book 
for you , " 
he said. " It will tell you what 
you want to know. " 
She said nothing 
but sat down on her milk crate behind 
the board, holding the 
book tightly 
in her lap, and waited 
to play. 

English 
was the dullest 
class, with Mr. Espero's slow 
voice and the 
poets with names like John Greenleaf 
WhitÂ­
tier and William Cullen 
Bryant. 
" Whither, 
midst falling 
dew ,/While glow the heavens 
with the last steps 
of 
day . . . " It was stupid. And he read every word aloud, 
with 
care.

Chess Openings 

Modern 

She held Modern Chess Openings under her 

desk while 
Mr. Espero read. She went through 
variations 
one at a 
time, playing 
them out in her head . By 
the third day the 
notations
-P-K4, N-KB3-leapt into her quick mind 
as 
solid pieces 
on real squares. 
She saw them easily; 
there 
was no need for a board. She could sit there with 
in her lap, on the blue serge pleated 
skirt 
of the Methuen Home, and while Mr. 
Espero droned on 
about the enlargement 
of the spirit 
that great poetry 
gives 
us or read aloud lines 
like ' 'To him who in the love of 
nature 
holds/communion 
with her visible 
forms, she speaks 
a various 
language
, " the moves of chess games 
clicked 
into place before her half-shut yes
. In the back of the book 
were continuations 
down to the very end of some of the 
classic 
games, to twenty-seventh-move 
resignations 
or to 
draws on the fort
ieth, and she had learned to put the pieces 
through 
their entire 
ballet, 
sometimes 
catching 
her breath 
at the elegance 
of a combination 
attack 
or of a sacrifice or 
the restrained 
balance 
of force in a position
. And always 
her mind was on the win, or on 
the potential 
for the win. 
" ' For his gayer hours she has 
a voice of gladness/and 
a 
smile and eloquence 
of beauty . . . ' " read Mr. 
Espero, 
while Beth's mind danced 
in awe to, the geometrical 
roÂ­
coco of chess, rapt, enraptured
, drowning 
in the grand 
permutations 
as they opened to her 
soul, and her soul 
opened to them. 

"Cracker!" 

Jolene 
hissed 
as they left History. 
''Nigger, ' ' Beth hissed 
back. 
Jolene 
stopped 
and turned to stare at her. 

The following 
Saturday, Beth took six pills 
and gave herself 

22 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

up to their sweet 
chemistry
, holding 
one hand on her belly 
and the 
other on her cunt. That word -she knew 
about. 
It 
was one 
of the few things 
Mother had taught 
her before 
crashing 
the Chevy. " Wipe yourself,
" Mother would say 
in the bathr
oom. ' 'Be sure to wipe your cunt. 
' ' Beth 
moved her fingers up and down, the way 
Jolene 
had. It 
didn' t feel good. Not 
to her. She took her hand away and 
fell back into the mental ease of 
the pills. Maybe she was 
too young. Jolene 
was four years older 
and had fuzzy hair 
growing 
there. Beth had felt it. 

" Morning, Cracker," Jolene said softly. Her face was 
easy. 
"Jolene , " Beth said. Jolene 
stepped 
closer. 
There was 
nobody around, 
just the two of them. They were in 
the 
locker 
room, after gym. 
"What you want?" Jolene 
said. 
" I want to know what a cocksucker 
is. " 
Jolene 
stared 
at her a moment. 
Then she laughed
. "Shit," 
she said. " You know what a cock 
is?" 
"I don' t think so. " 
"That's what boys have. In the back of the health 
book. 
Like a thumb. 
' ' 
Beth nodded. She knew the picture. 
" Well, honey," Jolene 
said gravely , "there ' s girls 
likes 
to suck on that 
thumb. " 
Beth thought 
about it. " Isn' t that where they pee?" she 
said. 
"I expect 
it wipes clean, " Jolene 
said. 
Beth walked 
away feeling shocked. And she was still 
puzzled. 
She had heard of murderers 
and torturers; 
at 
home she had seen 
a neighbor 
boy beat his dog senseless 

23 

WALTER TEVIS 

with a heavy stick; 
but she did not understand 
how someÂ­
one could do what Jolene 
said. 

The next Sunday she won 
five games straight. She had 
been playing 
Mr. Shaibel for three months 
now, and she 
knew that he could no longer beat her. Not once. She 
anticipated 
every feint, every threat 
that he knew how to 
make. There was no way he could confuse 
her with his 
knights, 
or keep 
a piece posted 
on a dangerous 
square, or 
embarrass 
her by pinning 
an important 
piece. 
She could 
see it coming and could prevent 
it while continuing 
to set 
up for attack. 
When they had finished, 
he said, " You are eight years 
old?" 
" Nine in November." 
He nodded. 
" You will be here 
next Sunday?" 
" Yes . " 
" Good. Be sure . " 
O n S unday there was another 
man in the basement 
with 
Mr. Shaibel. He was thin and wore a striped 
shirt and tie. 
"This is Mr. Ganz, from the chess 
club , " Mr. Shaibel 
said. 
"Chess club?" Beth echoed, looking 
him over. He 
seemed a little like Mr. Schell, even though he was smiling. 
" We play at a club , " Mr. Shaibel 
said. 
"And I'm coach of the high 
school 
team. Duncan High, " 
Mr. Ganz said. She had never heard o f the school. 
" Would you like to play me a game?'' Mr. Ganz asked. 
For an answer Beth seated herself 
on the milk crate. 
There was a 
folding 
chair set up at the side of the board. 
Mr. Shaibel 
eased his heavy 
body into it, and Mr. Ganz 
sat on the stool. He reached 
forward in quick, 
nervous 

24 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

movement 
and picked up two pawns: 
one white and one 
black. 
He cupped his hands around them, shook them 
together 
a moment and then extended 
both arms toward 
Beth with the fists clenched
. 
"Choose a hand, " Mr. Shaibel 
said. 
" Why?'' 
"You play the color you choose. " 
"Oh." She reached 
out and barely touched 
Mr. Ganz's 
left hand. "This one . " 
He opened it. The black pawn lay in his 
palm. " Sorry, " 
he said, smiling. 
His smile made her uncomfortable. 
The board already 
had Black facing Beth. Mr. Ganz put 
the pawns back on 
their squares, moved pawn 
to king 
four, and Beth relaxed. 
She had learned every line of the 
Sicilian 
from her book. She played the queen bishop's 
pawn to its fourth 
square. When he brought 
the knight 
out, 
she decided 
to use 
the Najdorf. 
But Mr. Ganz was a bit too smart for that. He was a 
better 
player than Mr. Shaibel. Still, she knew after a 
dozen moves 
that he would be easy to beat, and she 
proceeded 
to do so, calmly 
and merciless! 
y, forcing him to 
resign 
after twenty-t
hree moves. 
He placed his king on its side 
on the board. " You 
certainly know the game, young lady. Do you have a team 
here?' ' 
She looked at him uncomprehend
ingly. 
"The other girls. Do they have a chess club?" 
' 'No.' ' 
"Then where do you play?" 
" Down here. " 
" Mr. Shaibel 
said you played a few games every 
SunÂ­
day. What do 
you do in between?" 

25 

WALTER TEVIS 

"Nothing. " 
"But how do you keep up?" 
She did not want to 
tell him about playing chess 
in her 
mind in class and in bed at night. To 
distract him she said, 
"Do you want to play another?
" 
He laughed. "All right. 
It' s your tum to play White . " 
She beat him even more handily, using the Reti OpenÂ­
ing. The book had called 
it a "hypermodern" system; she 
liked the way it used her king' s bishop. After twenty 
moves she stopped 
him to point out her upcoming 
mate in 
three. It took 
him half a minute to see it. He shook his 
head in 
disbelief 
and toppled 
his king. 
"You're astonishin
g , " he said. "I've never 
seen anyÂ­
thing like it.' ' He stood up and walked over to the furnace, 
where Beth had 
noticed 
a small shopping 
bag. "I have to 
go now. But I brought 
you a present
. ' ' He handed her the 
shopping 
bag. 
She looked 
inside, 
hoping to see another chess 
book. 
Something 
was wrapped 
in pink tissue paper. 
"Unwrap it, " Mr. Ganz said, smiling
. 
She lifted it out and pulled 
away the loosely 
wrapped 
paper. 
It was a pink doll 
in a blue print dress, with blond 
hair and a puckered-up 
mouth. She held it a moment and 
looked 
at it. 
"Well?" Mr. Ganz said. 
"Do you want another 
game?" Beth said, holding 
the 
doll by its arm . 
"I have to go, " Mr. Ganz said. " Maybe I ' ll come back 
next week.' ' 
She nodded. 
There was a big oilcan 
used for trash at the end of the 

26 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

hallway. 
As she passed it on the way to the Sunday 
afternoon movie, she dropped 
the doll into it. 

During Health 
Class she found the picture 
in the back of 
the book. On one page was a woman and on the facing 
page a man. They 
were line drawings , with no shading. 
Both stood with their 
arms at their 
sides and the 
palms of 
their hands turned out. At the V below her 
flat belly the 
woman had a simple, 
vertical 
line. The man had 
no such 
line, or if he had you couldn' t see it. What he had looked 
like a little 
purse with a round thing hanging 
down in front 
of it. Jolene 
said it was 
like a thumb. That was his cock. 
The teacher, 
Mr. Hume, was saying that 
you should 
have green leafy vegetables at least once a day. He began 
to write the 
names of vegetables 
on the board. Outside 
the 
big windows 
on Beth's left, pink japonica was beginning 
to bloom. She studied the 
drawing 
of a naked man, trying 
vainly 
to find some secr
et. 

Mr. Ganz was back the next Sunday. 
He had his own 
chessboa
rd with him. It had black and white 
squares, and 
the pieces 
were in a wooden box lined with red felt. They 
were made of polished 
wood; Beth could see the grain in 
the white ones. She reached 
out while Mr. Ganz was 
setting 
them up and lifted one of the knights. 
It was heavier 
than the ones she had used and had a circle 
of green felt on 
the bottom. She had never thought 
about owning things, 
but she wanted this chess 
set. 
Mr. Shaibel 
had set up his board in the usual place and 
got another 
milk crate for Mr. Ganz' s board. The two 
boards were now side by side, with a foot of space beÂ­
tween them. It was a sunny day, and bright 
light came in 

27 

WALTER TEVIS 

the window filtered 
through 
the short bushes by the walk 
at the edge of the building. 
Nobody spoke while the pieces 
were set up. Mr. 
Ganz took the knight 
gently 
from Beth's 
hand and put it on its home square. " We thought 
you 
could play us both , " he said. 
" At the same 
time?'' 
He nodded. 
Her milk crate had been put between 
the boards. She 
had White for both 
games, and in both of them she played 
pawn to king four. 
Mr. Shaibel 
replied 
with the Sicilian; 
Mr. Ganz played 
pawn to king four. She did not even 
have to pause and 
think about the continuat
ions. She played both 
moves and 
looked out the window. 
She beat them both 
effortlessly. Mr. Ganz set 
up the 
pieces, and they started 
again. This time she moved pawn 
to queen four on both and followed 
it with pawn 
to queen' s 
bishop 
four-the Queen' s Gambit. 
She felt deeply 
relaxed, 
almost in a dream. She had taken seven tranquil
izers at 
about midnight, 
and some of the languor 
was still 
in her. 
About midway into the games she was ï¿½taring out the 
window at a bush with pink blooms when she 
heard Mr. 
Ganz' s voice saying, 
" Beth, I've moved my bishop to 
bishop 
five" and she 
replied 
dreamlike, " Knight to K-5 . " 
The bush seemed to glow in the spring 
sunlight. 
" Bishop to knight 
four, " Mr. Ganz said. 
" Queen to queen four, " Beth replied, still 
not looking. 
" Knight to queen' 
s bishop three, " Mr. Shaibel said 
gruffly. 
" Bishop to knight five, " Beth said, her eyes on the 
pink blossoms
. 

28 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

"Pawn to knight 
three. " Mr. Ganz had a strange 
softÂ­
ness in his 
voice. 
" Queen to rook four check, " Beth said. 
She heard Mr. Ganz inhale 
sharply. After a second he 
said, " King to bishop 
one . " 
"That's mate i n three, " Beth said, without 
turning. 
"First check is with the knight. 
The.king 
has the two dark 
squares, and the bishop 
checks it. Then the knight 
mates. '' 
Mr. Ganz let out his 
breath 
slowly. "Jesus 
Christ! " he 
said. 

29 

CHAPTER 2 

They were 
watching 
the Saturday-
afternoon 
movie when 
Mr. Fergussen 
came to take her to Mrs. Deardorf
f' s office. 
It was a movie about table manners 
called 
"How to Act at 
Dinnertime, " so she didn't mind leaving
. But she was 
frightened. 
Had they found out that she never went to 
chapel? 
That she saved pills? 
Her legs trembled 
and her 
knees felt funny as Mr. Fergussen, wearing 
his white pants 
and white T -shirt, 
walked her down the long hallway , 
down the green 
linoleum 
with black cracks 
in it. Her thick 
brown shoes squeaked 
on the linoleum, 
and she squinted 
her eyes under 
the bright fluorescent 
lights. The day before 
had been her 
birthday. 
No one had taken any 
notice 
of it. 
Mr. Fergussen, as usual, had nothing 
to say: he walked 
smartly 
down the hall ahead 
of her. At the door with 
the 
frosted glass panel 
and the 

words HELEN DEARDORFF-

30 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

SUPERINTENDENT he stopped. Beth pushed open the door 
and went inside. 
A secretary 
in a white blouse 
told her to 
go on to the 
back office. Mrs. Deardorf
f was expecting 
her. She pushed 
open the big wooden door and walked in. In the red 
armchair 
sat Mr. Ganz, wearing 
a brown suit. Mrs. 
Deardorff was sitting 
behind a 
desk. She peered 
at Beth 
over tortoiseshell 
glasses. 
Mr. Ganz smiled 
self-consciously 
and rose halfway from the chair when she came in. Then 
he sat down again awkwardly. 
"Elizabeth , " Mrs . Deardorff said. 
She had closed the 
door behind 
her and 
now stood a few 
feet away from it. She looked at Mrs. Deardorff. 
" Elizabeth, 
Mr. Ganz tells me that you are a"-she 
adjusted the glasses 
on her 
nose-"a gifted 
child. " Mrs. 
Deardorff 
looked at her for a moment as 
though she were 
expected 
to deny 
it. When Beth said 
nothing, she went on, 
"He has an unusual 
request 
to make of us. He would like 
you to be taken to the high school 
on ' ' She 
looked 
over at Mr. 
Ganz again. 
"On Thursday
, " Mr. Ganz 
said. 
" On Thursday. In the afternoon. He maintains 
that you 
are a phenomenal 
chess player. He 
would like you to 
perform 
for the chess club. 
' ' 
Beth said nothing. 
She was still 
frightened. 
Mr. Ganz cleared his throat. " We have a dozen 
memÂ­
bers, and I'd like you 
to play them." 
" Well?" Mrs . Deardorff 
said. "Would you like to do 
that? It can 
be arranged 
as a field trip . ' ' She smiled 
grimly 
at Mr. Ganz. "We like to give our girls 
a chance for 
experience 
outside
. " That was 
the first time Beth had 
heard of 
it; she knew of no one who ever went anywhere. 

3 1 

WALTER TEVIS 

" Yes , " Beth said. "I'd like to. " 
"Good , " Mrs. Deardorff said. "It's setï¿½led, 
then. Mr. 
Ganz and one of the girls from the high 
school 
will pick 
you up after lunch Thursday.' ' 
Mr. Ganz got up to go, and Beth started 
to follow, but 
Mrs. Deardorff 
called 
her back. 
"Elizabeth
, " she said when they 
were alone, "Mr. 
Ganz informs 
me that you have been playing chess with 
our custodia
n . ' ' 
Beth was uncertain 
what to. say. 
" With Mr. Shaibel. " 
" Yes, ma'a
m." 
"That is very irregular, 
Elizabeth. Have 
you gone 
to the 
basement?'' 
For a moment 
she considered lying. 
But it would be too 
easy for Mrs. Deardorff to find out. " Yes, ma'am," she 
said again
. 
Beth expected 
anger, but Mrs . 
Deardorf
f's voice was 
surprisingly 
relaxed. " We can' t have that, Elizabeth, " she 
said. "As much as Methuen believes 
in excellence, 
we 
can' t have you 
playing 
chess in the basement." 
Beth felt her stomach 
tighten
. 
" I believe 
there are chess sets in the game closet, " Mrs. 
Deardorff continued. 
" I ' ll have Fergussen look into it." 
A phone began ringing 
in the outer office and a little 
light on the phone began flashing. 
' 'That will be all, 
Elizabeth
. Mind your manners 
at the high school 
and be 
sure your nails are clean.' ' 

In "Major Hoople" i n the funnies, Major Hoople beÂ­
longed to the Owl's Club. It was 
a place where men sat 
in 
big old chairs 
and drank 
beer and talked 
about President 

32 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

Eisenhower 
and how much money their 
wives spent on 
hats. Major Hoople had a huge belly, like Mr. Shaibel, 
and when he 
was at the Owl's Club with a dark 
beer bottle 
in his hands, his words came from his mouth with little 
bubbles. He said things 
like "Harrumph" and " Egad ! " in 
a balloon 
on top 
of the bubbles. That was a "club ." It was 
like the library reading 
room at Methuen. 
Maybe she 
would play the twelve 
people 
in a room like that. 
She hadn' t told anyone. 
Not even Jolene. 
She lay in bed 
after lights 
out and thought 
about it with an expectant 
quiver 
in her stoma
ch. Could she play that many games? 
She rolled 
over on her back and nervously 
felt the pocket 
of her pajamas. There were two in there. It was six days 
until Thursday
. Maybe Mr. Ganz meant she would play 
one game with one person and then one game with anÂ­
other, 
if that was how 
you did it. 
She had looked up 
"phenomenal
. " The dictiona
ry said: 
' 'extraor
dinary; 
outstanding; 
remarkab
le.' ' She repeated 
these 
words silently 
to herself 
now: "extraordinary; 
outstand
ing; 
remarkab
le. ' ' They became a tune in her mind. 
She tried to picture 
twelve 
chessboa
rds at once, spread 
out in a row on the ceiling. 
Only four or five were 
really 
clear. She took the black pieces 
for herself 
and assigned 
the whites 
to "them" and then had " them" move pawn to 
king four, and she responded 
with the Sicilian. 
She found 
she could keep 
five games going and concentrate 
on one at 
a time while the other four waited for her attenti
on. 
From out at the desk down the corridor 
she heard a 
voice say 
' 'What time is it no
w?'' and another voice 
reply 
" It's two-twenty
. " Mother used to talk about the "wee, 
small hours. " This was one 
of them. Beth 
kept playing 

33 

WALTER TEVIS 

chess, keeping 
five imaginary 
games going at once. She 
had forgotten 
about the 
pills 
in her pocket. 
The next morning Mr. Fergussen handed her the little 
paper cup as usual but when she looked down into 
it there 
were two orange vitamin 
tablets 
and nothing 
else. She 
looked back up at him, behind the little 
window of the 
pharmacy. 
"That's it," he said. "Ne
xt." 
She didn' t move, even though the girl behind her was 
pushing 
against 
her. "Where are the green ones?" 
" You don' t get them anymore , " Mr. Fergussen 
said. 
Beth stood 
on tiptoe 
and looked over 
the counter. 
There, 
behind Mr. Fergussen, 
stood the big glass jar, still 
a third 
full of green pills. There must have 
been hundreds of them 
in there, like tiny jellybeans. "There they are, " she said 
and pointed. 
" We're getting 
rid of them, " he said. "It's a new law. 
No more tranquilizers for kids. " 
"It's 
my tum , " said Gladys, 
behind her. 
Beth didn' t move. She opened her mouth to speak but 
nothing came 
out. 
"It's my turn for vitamins
, " Gladys said, louder. 

There had been nights when 
she was so involved 
in chess 
that she had slept without 
pills. But this wa
sn't one of 
them. She 
could not think about chess. There were 
three 
pills in her toothbrush 
holder, 
and that was it. Several 
times she decided 
to take one of them but then decided 
not to. 

" I hear tell you going to exhibit yourself,
" Jolene 
said. 
She giggled, more 
to herself than 
to Beth. " Going to play 
chess in front of people.' ' 

34 

THE QUEEN

'S GAMBIT 

' 'Who told you?'' Beth said. They were 
in the locker 
room after volleyball. Jolene's breasts, 
not there a year 
before, jiggled 
under her gym shirt . 
"Child, I just know things, " Jolene 
said. "Ain ' t that 
where it's like checkers 
but the pieces jump 
around crazy? 
My Uncle Hubert played that.' ' 
" Did Mrs. Deardorff tell you?" 
"Never go near that lady." Jolene smiled confidenÂ­
tially. "It was Fergussen. He told me you going to the 
high school 
downtown. Day after tomorrow. " 
Beth looked at her incre
dulously. The staff didn't trade 
confidences with 
the orphans . ' 'Fergussen 
. . . ? ' ' 
Jolene 
leaned 
over and spoke seriously. " He and I been 
friendly from time to time. Don't want you talking about 
it, hear?'' 
Beth nodded. 
Jolene 
pulled 
back and went on drying 
her hair with 
the 
white gym towel. After volleyball 
you could always stretch 
out the time, showering 
and getting 
dressed, 
before going 
to study hal l . 
Beth thought 
o f something. After a moment she spoke 
in a low voice, 
"Jolene." 
' 'Uh huh.' ' 
" Did Fergussen give you green pills? 
Extra ones?" 
Jolene 
looked at 
her hard. Then her 
face softened. "No, 
honey. I wish he would. But they got the whole state after 
'em for what they been doing with those 
pills. " 
"They're still 
there. In the big jar." 
"That a fact?" Jolene 
said. " I ain' t noticed. " She kept 
looking 
at Beth. "I noticed 
you been edgy lately. You 
having withdraw symptoms? ' ' 

35 

WALTER TEVIS 

Beth had used 
her last pill 
the night before. "I don' t 
know , ' ' she said
. 
" You look around, " Jolene said. "They'll be some 
nervous orphans around 
here the next few 
days. " She 
finished drying 
her hair and stretched. With the light comÂ­
ing from behind her and with her frizzy hair and her big
, 
wide eyes, Jolene was beautif
ul. Beth felt ugly, sitting 
there on the bench beside 
her. Pale and little 
and ugly. 
And she was scared to go to bed tonight without 
pills. She 
had been sleeping 
only two or three hours a night for the 
past two nights
. Her eyes felt gritty 
and the 
back of her 
neck, even right after 
showering, was sweaty. 
She kept 
thinking 
about that big glass jar behind Fergussen, filled 
with green pills 
a third of the way 
up-enough 
to fill her 
toothbrush holder 
a hundred times. 

Going to the high school 
was her first ride in a car 
since 
she came 
to Methuen. That was fourteen months ago. 
Nearly fifteen. Mother had died in a car, a black one like 
this, with a sharp piece of the steering 
wheel in her eye. 
The woman with the clipboard had told her, 
while Beth 
stared 
at the mole on the woman's cheek and said noth
ing. 
Had felt nothing, 
either. 
Mother had passed 
on, the woman 
said. The funeral 
would be in three days. The coffin 
would 
be closed. 
Beth knew what a coffin was; Dracula 
slept in 
one. Daddy had passed on the year 
before, because 
of a 
"carefree 
life , " as Mother put 
it. 
Beth sat in the back 
of the car with 
a big, embarrassed 
girl named Shirley
. Shirley 
was in the chess club. Mr. 
Ganz drove. 
There was a knot as tight 
as wire in Beth's 
stomach. She kept her knees pressed 
together 
and looked 
straight 
ahead at the back of Mr. Ganz's neck in its striped 

36 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

collar and at the cars and buses ahead of their car, moving 
back and forth outside 
the windshield. 
Shirley 
tried to make conversat
ion. " Do you play the 
King's Gambit?" 
Beth nodded, 
but was afraid to speak. 
She hadn' t slept 
at all the night before, and very little 
for nights 
before that. 
Last night 
she had heard Fergussen talking 
and laughing 
with the lady at Receptio
n; his heavy laughter 
had rolled 
down the corridor 
and under the doorway into the ward 
where she lay, stiff as steel, on 
her cot. 
But one thing had happened-someth
ing unexpected
. 
As she was about 
to leave with Mr. 
Ganz, Jolene 
came 
running 
up, gave Mr. Ganz one of her sly looks and said, 
"Can we talk for a second?" Mr. Ganz said it 
was okay, 
and Jolene 
took Beth hastily 
aside and handed her three 
green pills. "Here, honey, " she said, "I can tell you need 
these. " Then Jolene 
thanked Mr. 
Ganz and skipped 
off to 
class, her geography 
book under one thin arm. 
But there was no chance to take the pill s . Beth had them 
in her pocket 
right now, but she was afraid. Her mouth 
was dry. She knew she could pop 
them down and probably 
no one would notice. 
But she was frightened. They would 
be there soon. Her head 
was spinning
. 
The car stopped 
at a light. 
Across the intersection 
was a 
Pure Oil 
station 
with a 
big blue sign. Beth 
cleared her 
throat. " I need to 
go to the bathroom. " 
"We'll be there in ten minutes, " Mr. Ganz said
. 
Beth shook 
her head firmly. " I can' t wait . " 
Mr. Ganz shrugged. 
When the light changed, he drove 
across 
the intersection 
and into the gas station
. Beth went 
in the room 
marked LADIES and locked 
the door behind 
her. It was a filthy 
place, 
with smear marks on the 
white 

37 

WALTER TEVIS 

tiles 
and a chipped 
basin. She ran the cold-water tap 
for a 
moment and put 
the pills 
in her mouth. Cupping 
her hand, 
she filled it with water and washed them down. Already 
she felt better. 

It was a big classroom with three blackboards 
across 
the 
far wall. Printed 
in large capitals 
on the center 
board was 
WELCOME BETH HARMON! in white chalk, 
and on the 
wall above this were color photographs 
of President 
EisenÂ­
hower and Vice President 
Nixon. Most of the regular 
desks had been taken out of the room and were lined along 
the hallway 
wall outside; 
the rest had been pushed together 
at the far end. Three folding tables 
had been set up to 
make a U in the center 
of the room, and on each of these 
were four green-and-beige 
paper chessboards 
with plastic 
pieces. 
Metal chairs 
sat inside 
the U , facing the black 
pieces, but there were 
no chairs 
facing the white ones. 
It had 
been twenty minutes 
since the stop at the Pure Oil 
station 
and she was no longer 
trembling, but 
her eyes 
smarted and her joints 
felt sore. She was wearing her 
navy 
pleated skirt and 
a white blouse with red letters 
spelling 
Methuen over the pocket. 
There was no one in the room when they came 
in; Mr. 
Ganz had unlocked 
the door with 
a key from his pocket. 
After a minute a bell rang and there. were the 
sounds of 
footsteps 
and some shouts in the hallway, and students 
began to come in. They were mostly boys. 
Big boys, as 
big as men; this was 
senior 
high. They wore sweaters and 
slouched 
with their hands in their pockets. 
Beth wondered 
for a moment where she was supposed 
to sit. But she 
couldn' t sit if she 
was going to play 
them all at once; 
she would have to walk from board to board to make the 

38 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

moves. " Hey, Allan. Watch out! " one boy shouted 
to 
another, 
jerking his thumb toward Beth. Abruptly 
she saw 
herself 
as a small unimportant 
person-a plain, brownÂ­
haired orphan girl in dull institutional 
clothes. She was 
half the size of these easy, insolent 
students 
with their loud 
voices 
and bright 
sweaters. She felt powerless 
and silly
. 
But then she looked at the boards again, with 
the pieces 
set 
in the familiar pattern
, and the unpleasant 
feelings lessÂ­
ened. She might be out 
of place in this public high 
school, but she was 
not out of place with those twelve 
chessboar
ds. 
"Take your seats and be quiet, please. " Mr. Ganz 
spoke with surprising 
authority
. "Charles 
Levy will take 
Board Number One, since he's our top player. 
The rest 
can sit where they want to. There will be no talking 
during 
play . " 
Suddenly 
everyone 
was quiet, 
and they all began to 
look 
at Beth. She looked back 
at them, unblinki
ng, and she felt 
rising in 
her a hatred 
as black as night. 
She turned to Mr. Ganz. "Do I start now?" she asked. 
"With Board Number One." 
"And then I go to the next one?" 
"That's right, " he said. She realized 
that he hadn't 
even introduced 
her to 
the class. She stepped 
over to the 
first board, the one with Charles 
Levy sitting behind the 
black pieces. She reached 
out, picked up the king' s pawn 
and moved it to the fourth rank . 
The surprising 
thing was how 
badly they played. All of 
them. In the very first games of her life she had underÂ­
stood more than they did
. They left 
backward 
pawns all 
over the place, 
and their pieces 
were wide open for forks. 
A few of 
them tried crude mating atta
cks. She brushed 

39 

WALTER TEVIS 

those aside like flies. 
She moved briskly 
from board 
to 
board, her stomach 
calm and her hand steady. At each 
board it took only a second's glance 
to read the position 
and see what was called 
for. Her responses were quick, 
sure and deadly . Charles 
Levy was supposed 
to be the best 
of them; she had his pieces 
tied up beyond help in a dozen 
moves; in six more she mated him on the back rank with a 
knight-rook 
combinat
ion. 
Her mind 
was luminous, and her soul sang 
to her in the 
sweet moves of chess. The classroom smelled 
of chalk 
dust and her shoes squeaked as 
she moved down the rows 
of players. The room was silent; 
she felt her own presence 
centered 
in it, small 
and solid and in command. Outside, 
birds sang, but she did not 
hear them. Inside, 
some of the 
students 
stared 
at her. Boys came in from the 
hallway and 
lined up along 
the back wall to watch the homely girl from 
the orphanage 
at the edge 
of town who moved from player 
to player with the determined 
energy of a Caesar in 
the 
field, a Pavlova under 
the lights. There were about a dozen 
people watching. 
Some smirked 
and yawned, 
but others 
could feel the energy in the room, the presence 
of someÂ­
thing that had never, 
in the long hstory 
of this tired old 
schoolroom, been 
felt there before. 
What she did 
was at bottom shockingly 
trivial, but the 
energy of her amazing 
mind crackled 
in the room for those 
who knew how to listen. Her chess moves blazed with it. 
By the end of 
an hour and a half, 
she had beaten 
them all 
without 
a single 
false or wasted move. 
She stopped 
and looked around her. Captured 
pieces 
sat 
in clusters beside 
each board. A few students 
were staring 
at her, but most avoided 
her eyes. There was scattered 
applause. 
She felt her cheeks flush; something 
in her 

40 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

reached 
out desperately tow
ard the boards, the dead 
posiÂ­
tions on them. There was nothing lef
t there 
now. She was 
just a little 
girl again, 
without 
power. 
Mr. Ganz presented 
her with a two-pound 
box of WhitÂ­
man's chocolates 
and took her out to the car. Shirley 
got in 
without 
a word, careful not to touch against 
Beth in the 
back seat. They drove in silence back 
to the Methuen 
Home. 
Five o'clock study hall was intolera
ble. She tried playing 
chess in her mind, but it seemed for once pale 
and meanÂ­
ingless 
after the afternoon at the high school. She tried 
reading Geography, since there was a test the next day, but 
the big book was practically 
all pictures, and the pictures 
meant little 
to her. Jolene 
was not in the room , and she 
was desperate 
to see Jolene, to see 
if there were 
any more 
pills. Every now and then she touched 
her blouse 
pocket 
with the palm of her hand in a kind of superstitious 
hope 
that she would feel the little 
hard surface of a pil l . But 
there was nothing 
there. 
Jolene 
was at supper, 
eating 
her Italian 
spaghetti
, when 
Beth came in and picked up her tray. She went over to 
Jolene's table before getting 
her food. There was another 
black girl with her. Samantha, 
a new one. Jolene 
and she 
were talking. 
Beth walked straight 
up to them and said to Jolene, 
" Have you got any more?" 
Jolene frowned and shook her head. Then she said, 
"How was the exhibit? 
You do okay?" 
"Okay, " Beth said. "Haven' t you got just one?" 
" Honey, " Jolene 
said, turning away, "I don' t want to 
hear about it.' '

WALTER TEVIS 

The Saturday afternoon movie in the library was The 
Robe. It had Victor Matur
e in it 
and was spiritual; 
all the 
staff was there, sitting 
attentive 
in a special 
row of chairs 
at the back, near the shuddering 
projector. 
Beth kept her 
eyes nearly 
shut during 
the first half-hour; 
they were 
red 
and sore. She had 
not slept at all on Thursday 
night and 
had dozed off for only 
an hour or so Friday. Her stomach 
was knotted, and there was the vinegar 
taste in her throat. 
She slouched 
in her folding chair with her 
hand in her skirt 
pocket, 
feeling the screwdriver 
she had put there in the 
morning. 
Walking 
into the boys' woodworking 
shop after 
breakfast, she took it from 
a bench. No one saw her do 
it. 
Now she squeezed 
it in her hand until her fingers 
hurt, 
took a deep breath, stood up and edged her way to the 
door. Mr. Fergussen 
was sitting 
there, proctori
ng. 
"Bathroom, " Beth whispered. 
Mr. Fergussen nodded, his 
eyes on Victor Mature, bareÂ­
chested in 
the arena. 
She walked purposively 
down the narrow hallway, over 
the wavy places 
in the faded linoleum, past the girls' 
room 
and down to the Multi-P
urpose Room, with its Christian 
Endeavour magazines 
Books 
and, against 
the far wall, the padlocked 
window that said 

and Reader's Digest Condensed 

PHARMACY. 

There were some small wooden stools 
in the room; she 
picked up one of them. There was no one around. She 
could hear gladiatorial 
shouts 
from the movie in the library 
but nothing 
else except her footsteps. They sounded 
very 
loud. 
She set the 
stool in front of the window and climbed 
onto it. This put her face on a level with the hasp and 
padlock, 
at the top
. The window itself, 
made of frosted 

42 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

glass with chicken wire 
in it, was framed in wood. The 
wood had been thickly 
painted 
with white enamel. Beth 
examined 
the screws that 
held the painted hasp. There 
was 
paint in their slots. She frowned, and her heart began to 
beat faster. 
During the rare times when Daddy had been home, and 
sober, 
he had liked to do little jobs 
around the house. The 
house was 
an old one, in a poorer 
part of town, and there 
was heavy paint on the vroodwork. 
Beth, five and six 
years old, had helped 
Daddy take the old switch 
plates 
and 
outlet 
plates 
off the walls with his big 
screwdriver. 
She 
was good at it, and Daddy praised 
her for it. ' 'You catch 
on real quick, sweetiep
ie," he said. She had never been 
happier. 
But when there was paint in the screw slots he 
would say, "Let Daddy fix that for you , " and would do 
something 
to get the screw head ready so that all 
she had 
to do was put the blade in 
the slot and tum. But what did 
he do to get that paint away? And which way 
should you 
turn the screwdriver? 
For a moment she almost 
choked in a 
sudden flush of inadequacy
. The shouts from the film 
arena rose to a roar, and the 
volume of the frenetic music 
rose with it. She could get down off the 
stool and go back 
and take her seat. 
But if she did that, she would go on feeling the way 
she 
felt now. She would have to lie in bed at night with the 
light from under the door 
in her face and the sounds from 
the corridor 
in her ears and the bad taste 
in her mouth, and 
there would 
be no relief, 
no ease in her body. She took the 
screwdriver 
handle and banged the 
two big screwheads 
with it. Nothing 
happened. She gritted 
her teeth and thought 
hard. Then she nodded grimly, took a 
fresh purchase on 
the screwdriver, 
and using the comer of its blade, began 
to 

43 

WALTER TEVIS 

chisel 
out the paint. That was what Daddy had done
. She 
pressed 
with both hands, keeping 
her feet firmly 
on the 
stool, and pushed along the 
slot. Some paint chipped 
loose, exposing 
the brass of the screw. She kept pushing 
with the sharp corner and 
more came loose. 
Then a big 
flake of paint 
fell off, and the slot was exposed. 
She took the screwdriver 
in her right 
hand, put the blade 
carefully in the slot and turned-to 
the left, the way Daddy 
had taught 
her. She remembered 
it now. She was good at 
remembering. She twisted as hard as she could. Nothing 
happened
. She took the screwdriver 
away from the slot, 
gripped 
it in 
both hands and put the blade back in. Then 
she hunched 
her shoulders 
together 
and twisted until 
her 
hands felt sharp pains 
in them. And suddenly something 
squeaked, 
and the 
screw loosened. 
She kept twisting 
until 
she could take it out the rest 
of the way 
with her finger 
and 
put it 
in her blouse 
pocket. 
Then she went to 
work on the 
other screw. The part of the hasp 
she was working 
on was 
supposed 
to be held by four screws-one at each comerÂ­
but only two had 
been put in. She had noticed 
this during 
the past several days, just 
as she had checked every 
day at 
Vitamin 
Time to see if the green 
pills 
were still 
there in the 
big jar. 
She put 
the other screw in her pocket, and the end of the 
hasp came loose by itself, 
with the big padlock 
still 
hangÂ­
ing there, the other end supported by the screws that held 
it to the window frame. It had not 
taken her long to 
understand 
that you would have 
to remove only half a 
hasp, not both halves, the way it had looked 
at first. 
She pulled open the window, leaning back 
so it could go 
by her, and put her head inside. The 
light bulb was off, 
but she 
could see the outline 
of the big jar. She put her 

44 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

arms inside 
the opening, and standing 
on tiptoe, 
pushed 
herself 
as far forward as she could. That put her belly on 
the sill 
of the window. She began to wriggle, and her feet 
came away 
from the stool. There was a slightly 
sharp edge 
along the window sill, and it felt as though it were cutting 
her. She ignored 
it and kept 
on wriggling, 
doing it meÂ­
thodically, inching 
forward. She both 
felt and heard her 
blouse 
ripping
. She ignored it; she 
had another 
blouse 
in 
her locker and could change. 
Now her hands touched 
the cool, smooth surface of a 
metal table. That was the narrow white table Mr. Fergussen 
stood against 
when he gave them their 
medicine. 
She 
inched forward again, and her weight came down 
on her 
hands. There were some boxes 
there. She pushed 
them 
aside, 
clearing a place for herself. 
Now it was easier 
to 
move. She let 
her weight 
come forward 
with the sill under 
her hips until it scraped 
the tops 
of her legs and she was 
able to let 
herself 
flop onto the 
table, 
twisting 
herself 
at the 
last second so she wouldn't fall off it. She was inside! She 
took a 
couple of deep breaths 
and climbed down. There 
was enough light for 
her to see 
all right. She 
walked over 
to the far wall of the tiny room and stopped
, facing the 
dimly visible jar. 
It had a glass cover. 
She lifted this and 
set it silently 
on the table. 
Then she slowly 
reached 
inside 
with both hands. Her fingertips 
touched 
the smooth surface 
of tens of pills, hundreds 
of pills. She pushed her hand 
deeper, 
burying them 
up to the wrists. 
She breathed 
in 
deeply and held her breath 
for a long time. Finally 
she let 
it out 
in a sigh and removed 
her right hand with a fistful of 
pills. She did not count them, simply put them in her 
mouth and swallowed until 
they had all gone down. 
Then she stuffed three handfuls 
of pills in her skirt 

45 

WALTER TEVIS 

pocket. 
On the wall to the right of the window was a Dixie 
cup dispenser. 
She was able to reach it by standing 
on 
tiptoe 
and stretching. 
She took four paper cups. She had 
decided 
on that number the night bef
ore. She carried them 
over, stacked , to the table that held the pill jar, set them 
down neat
ly, and filled them one at a time. Then she stood 
back and looked at the jar. The level had dropped 
to 
almost 
half what it had been. The problem 
seemed insoluÂ­
ble. She would have to wait 
and see what happened
. 
Leaving 
the cups, she went to the door 
that Mr. Fergussen 
used when he went to 
do pharmacy 
duty. She would leave 
that way, unlocking 
it from the 
inside, 
and make two trips 
to carry the pills 
to the metal stand 
by her bed. She had a 
nearly empty 
Kleenex 
box to put them in. She would 
spread a few sheets 
of Kleenex 
on top 
and put the box in 
the bottom of her enameled 
nightstand
, under her clean 
underwear 
and socks. 
But the door would not open. It was locked in some 
serious 
way. She examined 
the knob and latch, 
feeling 
carefully with her hands. There was a thick, 
heavy sensaÂ­
tion at the back of her 
throat 
as she did 
this, and her arms 
were numb, like the arms of a dead 
person. What she had 
suspected 
when the door wouldn't open turned out 
to be 
true: you 
had to have 
a key even from the inside. 
And she 
could not climb back out the little 
window carrying 
four 
Dixie cups full of tranquiliz
ers . 
She grew frantic. They would miss her at the movie. 
Fergussen would be looking 
for her. The projector 
would 
break down and all the children would be sent into the 
Multi-Purpose 
Room, with Fergussen monitoring 
them, 
and here she would be. But deeper than that, 
she felt 
trapped , the same wretched, 
heart-stopping 
sensation she 

46 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

had felt when she was taken from home and put in this 
institution 
and made to sleep in a ward with twenty strangÂ­
ers and hear noises 
all night 
long that were, in a way, as 
bad as the shouting 
at home, when Daddy and Mother 
were there-the 
shouting 
from the brightly 
lit kitchen. 
Beth had 
slept in the dining 
room on a folding cot. She 
felt 
trapped 
then, too, and her arms were numb. There was a 
big space under 
the door that separated 
dining 
room from 
kitchen; 
the light had streamed 
in under it, along with 
the 
shouted 
words. 
She gripped 
the doorknob 
and stood still 
for a long 
moment, 
breathing 
shallowly. Then 
her heart began beatÂ­
ing almost normally 
again and feeling came back into her 
arms and hands. She could always get out 
by climbing 
through 
the window. She had a pocket full of pills. She 
could set the Dixie cups on the white table inside 
the 
window and then, when she was back on the stool 
outside, 
she could 
reach in and take them out, one at a time. She 
could visualiz
e it all , like a chess position. 
She carried 
the cups over 
to the table. 
She had begun to 
sense in herself 
an enormous 
calm, like the calm she had 
felt that day at 
the high school when she knew she 
was 
unbeatable. When she 
set down the fourth cup she turned 
and looked back at the 
glass jar. Fergussen 
would know 
that pills had been stolen. That 
could not be hidden. 
Sometimes 
her father had said, " In for a 
dime, in for a 
dollar." 
She took the jar over to the table and poured the conÂ­
tents of the Dixie 
cups back into it, stepped 
back and 
checked. It would be simple 
to lean over from the outside 
and lift the jar out. She knew, too, where she could hide 
it, on the shelf of 
a disused 
janitors' 
closet 
in the girls' 

47 

WALTER TEVIS 

room. There was an old galvanized 
bucket up there that 
was never used; the jar would fit into it. There was also a 
short ladder in the closet, 
and she could use it safely 
because a person 
could lock the door on 
the girls' 
room 
from the inside. Then, if there was a search 
for the missing 
pills, 
even if they found them, they couldn't be traced 
to 
her. She would take only 
a few at 
a time and wouldn' t tell 
anyone-not 
even Jolene. 
The pills 
she had gulped down a few minutes 
before 
were beginning 
to reach her 
mind. All of her nervousness 
had vanished. With clear purposef
ulness, she climbed up 
on Mr. Fergussen's white table, 
put her head out the 
window and looked around her 
at the still-empty room . 
The jar of pills 
was a few inches from 
her left knee. She 
wriggled 
her way 
through 
the window and onto the stool. 
Standing 
up high there, she felt calm, powerful, in charge 
of her life. 
She leaned 
forward 
dreamily 
and took the jar by its rim 
in both hands. A fine relaxation 
had spread through 
her 
body. She let 
herself 
go limp, staring 
down into 
the depths 
of green pills. Stately 
music came from 
the movie in the 
Library. Her toes were still 
on the stool and her body was 
loosely 
jackknifed over the window ledge; 
she no longer 
felt the sharp edge. She 
was like a limp rag 
doll. As her 
eyes lost focus, the green became 
a bright 
luminous 
blur. 
h!'' The voice 
seemed to come from a place 
inside 
She blinked. 
It was a womÂ­
an's voice, harsh, 
like Mother's. She did not look around. 
Her fingers 
and thumbs on the side of the jar had gone 
loose. 
She squeezed 
them together 
and picked up the jar. 
She felt herself 
moving in slow motion, like slow motion 
in a movie where someone 
falls from a horse at a rodeo 

' 'Elizabet
her head. "Elizabeth!" 

48 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

and you see him float gently 
to the ground as though it 
could not hurt 
at all . She lifted the jar with both hands 
and 
turned, and the 
bottom of the jar hit the window ledge with 
a dull ringing 
sound and her wrists 
twisted and the j ar 
came loose from her hands and exploded 
on the edge of 
the stool at her feet. The fragments, mixed 
with hundreds 
of green pellets
, cascaded 
to the linoleum 
floor. Bits of 
glass caught 
light like 
rhinestones 
and lay in place shiverÂ­
ing while the green pills rolled 
outward like a bright 
waterfall toward Mrs
. Deardorff. Mrs. Deardorff was standÂ­
ing a few feet away 
from her, saying, 
" Elizabeth! " over 
and over again. After what seemed 
a long time, 
the pills 
stopped 
moving. 
Behind Mrs. Deardorff was Mr. Fergussen in his 
white 
pants and 
T-shirt. 
Next to him stood Mr. Schell, and just 
behind them, crowding 
to see what had happened
, were 
the other children, 
some of them still 
blinking 
from the 
movie that had just ended. Every person in the room was 
staring 
at her, high on the miniature stage of her stool with 
her hands a foot apart as though she were still 
holding 
the 
glass jar. 
Fergussen rode with 
her in the brown 
staff car and carÂ­
ried her into the 
hospital 
to the little 
room where the lights 
were bright 
and they 
made her swallow 
a gray rubber 
tube. 
It was easy. Nothing 
mattered . 
She could still 
see the 
green mound of pills 
in the jar. There were strange 
things 
happening 
inside 
her, but it 
didn't matter. 
She fell asleep 
and woke only for a moment when someone pushed 
a 
hypodermic 
needle 
in her arm. She did not 
know how 
long 
she was 
there, but she did not 
spend the 
night. 
Fergussen 
drove her back the same 
evening. She sat in the 
front seat 
now, awake and unworried. The hospital 
was on the cam-

49 

WALTER TEVIS 

pus, where Fergussen 
was a graduate 
student; 
he pointed 
out the Psychology 
Building as they drove 
past it. "That's 
where I go to school, " he said. 
She merely nodded. She pictured Fergussen as a stuÂ­
dent, taking 
true-false 
tests and 
holding 
his hand up when 
he wanted to leave the room. She had never liked him 
before, had thought 
of him as just one of the others. 
"Jesus, kid , " he said, "I thought 
Deardorff would 

explode. ' ' 

She watched 
the trees go by outside 
the car window. 
"How many did you 
take? Twenty?" 
"I didn' t count. 
" 
He laughed. "Enjoy 'em , " he said. "It'll 
be cold turÂ­
key tomorrow. ' ' 

At Methuen she went directly 
to bed and slept deeply for 
twelve hours. In the 
morning, after 
breakfast, Fergussen, 
once again his 
usual distant 
self, told her to 
go to Mrs. 
Deardorf
f's office. Surprisingly
, she wasn
' t afraid. 
The 
pills had worn off, 
but she felt rested 
and calm. While 
getting 
dressed 
she had made 
an extraordinary 
discovery. 
Deep in the pocket 
of her serge skirt, 
survivors 
of her 
being caught, 
her trip to the hospital, her undressing 
and 
then dressing 
again, were twenty-three tranquilizers. She 
had to take her toothbrush 
out of its holder 
to get them all 
in. 
Mrs . Deardorff kept her waiting 
almost an hour. Beth 
didn't care. She read in National 
Geographic about a tribe 
of Indians 
who Jived in the holes of cliffs. Brown 
people 
with black hair and bad teeth. In the pictures 
there were 
children everywhere
, often snuggled 
up against 
the older 
people. It was all strange; 
she had never been touched 
very 

50 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

much by older people, except 
for punishment. 
She did not 
let herself 
think about Mrs. Deardorf
f's razor 
strop. If 
Deardorff was going to use it, she could take it. Somehow 
she sensed that what she had been caught doing was of a 
magnitude 
beyond usual punishment. 
And, deeper 
than 
that, she was aware of the complicity 
of the orphanage 
that 
had fed her and all the 
others 
on pills 
that would make 
them less restles
s , easier 
to deal with. 

Mrs . Deardorff did not 
invite 
her to 
sit. Mr. Schell 
was 
seated 
on Mrs. Deardorf
f's little 
blue chintz 
sofa, and in 
the red armchair sat Miss Lonsdale. Miss Lonsdale 
was in 
charge of chapel. Before she had started 
slipping off to 
play chess on Sundays, 
Beth had listened 
to some of Miss 
Lonsdale' s chapel 
talks. They were about Christian 
service 
and about how bad dancing 
and Communism 
were, as well 
as some other things 
Miss Lonsdale 
was not specific about. 
"We have been discussing 
your case for the past hour, 
Elizabeth, " Mrs . Deardorff 
said. Her 
eyes, fixed on Beth, 
were cold and dangerous. 
Beth watched 
her and said 
nothing. She felt something 
was going on that was like chess. In chess you did not let 
on what your 
next move would be. 
" Your behavior 
has come as a profound shock 
to all of 
us. Nothing"-for a moment the muscles 
at the sides of 
Deardorf
f's jaw stood out like steel cables-"nothing in 
the history of the Methuen 
Home has been so deplorable. 
It must not happen 
again. " 
Mr. Schell 
spoke up. "We are terribly 
disappointed-" 
"I can't sleep without the pills, " Beth said. 
There was a startled 
silence. 
No one had expected 
her to 
speak. 
Then Mrs . 
Deardorff said, "All the more reason 

5 1 

WALTER TEVIS 

why you should 
not have them . " But there was something 
odd in her voice, 
as though she were frightened. 
" You shouldn't have given them to us in the 
first 
place, " Beth said. 

"/will not have 
back talk from a child," Mrs. Deardorff 

said. She stood up and leaned 
across 
the desk toward Beth. 
" If you speak to me like that again, you will regret 
it. " 
The breath caught in Beth
's throat. 
Mrs. Deardorf
f's 
body seemed 
enormous. Beth drew 
back as though 
she had 
touched 
something 
white hot. 
Mrs. Deardorff sat down 
and adjusted her glasses. 
"Your 
library and playground 
privileges 
have been suspended. 
You will not attend 
the Saturday 
movies and you will be in 
bed promptly 
at eight o'clock in the evenings. Do you 
understa
nd?' ' 
Beth nodded. 

' 'Answer me. ' ' 

" Yes . " 
" You will be in chapel 
thirty 
minutes 
early and will be 
responsible 
for setting 
up the chairs. If you are in any way 
remiss 
in this, 
Miss Lonsdale 
has been instructed 
to report 
to me. If you are seen whispering 
to another 
.child 
in 
chapel 
or in any class, you will automatically 
be given ten 
demerits
. " Mrs. Deardorff paused. " You understand 
the 
meaning 
of ten demerits
, Elizabeth?" 
Beth nodd
ed . 
' 'Answer me.' ' 
" Yes . ' ' 
"Elizabeth, Miss Lonsdale 
informs 
me that you have 
often left chapel 
for long periods. That will end. You will 
remain in chapel for the full ninety 
minutes 
on Sundays. 
You will write a summary of each Sunday's talk and have 

52 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

it on my desk by Monday morning. " Mrs. Deardorff 
leaned 
back in the wooden desk chair and folded her hands 
across 
her lap. " And Elizabeth . . . " 
Beth looked at her carefully. " Yes, ma'am . " 
Mrs. Deardorff smiled 
grimly. "No more chess. " 

The next morning Beth went 
to the Vitamin Line 
after 
breakfast. She could see that the hasp had been replaced 
on the window and that this time there were screws in all 
four of the holes at 
each side of the padlock. 
When she came up to the window Fergussen looked at 
her and grinned. "Want to help yourself?" 
he said. 
She shook her head and held her hand out 
for the 
vitamin 
pills. He handed them to her and said, "Take it 
easy , Harmon. " His voice was pleasant; 
she had 
never 
heard him speak that way at vitamin 
time before. 

Miss Lonsdale wasn
't too bad. She seemed 
embarrassed at 
having Beth report 
to her at 
nine-thir
ty, and she showed 
her nervously 
how to unfold 
and set out the chairs, helping 
her with the first two rows of them. Beth was able to 
handle 
it easily 
enough, 
but listening 
to Miss Lonsdale talk 
about godless 
Communism 
and the way it was spreading 
in 
the United States was pretty 
bad. Beth was sleepy, and she 
hadn't had time to finish 
breakfast. But she 
had to pay 
attention 
so she 
could write her 
report. She listened to 
Miss Lonsdale 
talk on in her deadly serious 
way about 
how we all had 
to be careful, that Communism 
was like a 
disease 
and could infect 
you. It wasn
' t clear to Beth what 
Communism 
was. Something 
wicked people 
believed 
in, in 
other countries, like being Nazis and torturing 
Jews by the 
millions
. 

53 

WALTER TEVIS 

If Mrs. Deardorff hadn't told him, Mr. Shaibel would 
be expecting 
her. She wanted to be there to play chess, 
to 
try the King's Gambit against 
him. Maybe Mr. Ganz 
would be back with someone 
from the chess club for 
her to 
play. She let herself 
think of this only for a moment and 
her heart seemed to fil l . She wanted 
to run. She felt her 
eyes smarting. 
She blinked and shook her head and went on listening 
to 
Miss Lonsdale, 
who was talking 
now about 
Russia, 
a 
terrible 
place to be. 

" You should've 
saw yourself,
" Jolene 
said. "Up on that 
stool. Just floating 
around up there and Deardorff hollering 
at you . " 
' ' It felt funny
. ' ' 
" Shit, I bet. I bet it 
felt good." Jolene 
leaned a little 
closer. 
"How many of them downers 
you take, anyhow?" 
' 'Thirty . ' ' 
Jolene 
stared 
at her. ' 'She-it!'' she said. 

ian in Modern Chess Openings, 

It was difficult 
to sleep without 
the pills, but not 
impossiÂ­
ble. Beth saved the few she had 
for emergencies 
and 
decided 
that if she had to 
stay awake 
for several hours 
every night, 
she would spend the time learning 
the Sicili
an 
Defense. There were fifty-seven 
printed 
pages on the SicilÂ­
with a hundred 
and sevÂ­
enty different lines stemming 
from P-QB4. She would 
memorize 
and play through 
them all in her mind at night. 
When that was done and she knew 
all the variations, 
she 
could go on to the Pirc and the Nimzovitch 
and the Ruy 
dense book. 

Lopez. Modern Chess Openings was a thick, 

She would be all right. 

54 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

Leaving 
Geography 
class one day, she saw Mr. Shaibel 
at the end of the long hallway. He had a metal bucket on 
wheels with 
him and was 
mopping. The students 
were all 
going the 
other way, to the door that led to the yard 
for 
recess. She walked down to him, stopping 
where the floor 
was wet. She stood for about a minute until he looked up 
at her. 
" I ' m sorry, " she said. "They won' t let me play 
anymore." 
He frowned and nodded but said nothing. 
"I'm being punished. 
I . . . " She looked at his face. It 
registered 
nothing. "I wish I could play more with you . " 
He looked for a moment as if he 
was going to speak. 
But instead he turned his 
eyes to the floor, bent his fat 
body slightly and went back to 
mopping. Beth could sudÂ­
denly taste something 
sour in her mouth. She turned and 
walked back down the hall. 

Jolene 
said there were always adoptions 
around Christmas. 
The year after they stopped 
Beth from 
playing 
chess there 
were two in early December. Both pretty 
ones, Beth thought 
to herself. 
" Both white , " Jolene 
said aloud. 
The two beds stayed empty for a while. Then one 
morning before breakfast Fergus 
sen came into the Gir
ls' 
Ward. Some of the girls giggled 
to see him there with the 
heavy bunch of keys at his belt. He came up to Beth, who 
was putting 
on her socks. It was near her tenth birthday
. 
She got her second sock on and looked up at him. 
He frowned. "We got a new place for you, Harmon. 
Follow me. " 
She went with him across 
the ward, over to the far wal l . 
One o f the empty beds was there, under the window. It 

55 

WALTER TEVIS 

was a bit larger than the others 
and had more space around 
it. 
" You can put your things 
in the nightsta
nd, " Fergussen 
said. He looked at 
her for a minute. 
"It'll 
be nicer over 
here.' ' 
She stood there, amazed. It was the best bed in the 
ward. Fergussen 
was making a note on a clipboard. 
She 
reached out 
and touched 
his forearm with her fingertips, 
where the dark hairs grew, above his wristwat
ch. ' 'Thank 
you , " she said. 

56 

CHAPTER 3 

"I see 
that you will be thirteen in 
two months , Elizabeth, " 
Mrs. Deardorff said. 
"Yes, ma'am." Beth was seated 
in the straight-backed 
chair in front of Mrs . 
Deardorff's desk. Fergussen had 
come and taken her from study hall. It was eleven 
in the 
morning. She had not been in this office 
for over three 
years . 
The lady on the sofa suddenly 
spoke up, with strained 
cheerfulness. "Twelve 
is such a wonderful 
age ! " she said. 
The lady wore a blue cardigan 
over a silky dress. She 
would have 
been pretty 
except for all the rouge and l ipÂ­
stick and for the nervous 
way she 
worked her mouth when 
she talked. The man sitting 
next to her wore 
a gray 
salt-and-p
epper tweed suit with a vest. 
"Elizabeth 
has performed well 
in all her schoolwo
rk, " 

57 

WALTER TEVIS 

Mrs. Deardotff went on. "She is at the top of her class in 
Reading 
and Arithmet
ic.' ' 
"That's so nice! " the lady said. " I was such a scatterÂ­
brain at Arithmetic
. " She smiled at Beth brightly. "I'm 
Mrs. Wheatley
, " she added in a confidential 
tone. 
The man cleared his throat 
and said nothing. He looked 
as if he wanted to be somewhere else. 
Beth nodded 
at the lady's remark but could think of 
nothing 
to say. Why had they brought her 
here? 
Mrs . Deardotff went on about Beth
' s schoolwork while 
the lady 
in the blue 
cardigan 
paid rapt attention
. Mrs. 
Deardorff said nothing 
about the green pills 
or about Beth's 
chess playing; 
her voice seemed filled 
with a distant 
apÂ­
proval 
of Beth. When she had 
finished 
there was an emÂ­
barrassed 
silence for a while. 
Then the man cleared his 
throat 
again, shifted his weight 
uneasily 
and looked toward 
Beth as though he were looking 
over the top 
of her head. 
" Do they call you Elizabeth?" He sounded 
as if there 
were a bubble of air in his throat. 
' 'Or is it 
Betty?'' 
She looked 
at him. " Beth , " she said. "I'm called 
Beth." 
During the next few 
weeks she forgot about the visit 
in 
Mrs. Deardotf
f's office and absorbed 
herself 
in schoolÂ­
work and in reading. She had found a set of girls' 
books 
and was reading 
through 
them whenever 
she had 
a 
chance-in study 
halls, at night in bed, 
on Sunday afterÂ­
noons. 
They were 
about the adventures 
of the oldest 
daughÂ­
ter in a big, haphazard 
family. Six months before, Methuen 
had gotten 
a TV set for the lounge, 
and it was played for 
an hour every evening. 
But Beth found that she preferred 
Ellen Forbes' s adventures to 

I Love Lucy and Gunsmoke. 

58 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

She would sit up in bed, alone in the dormitory
, and read 
until lights 
out. No one bothered 
her. 
One evening 
in mid-Sept
ember she was alone 
reading 
when Fergussen 
came in. " Shouldn' t you be 
packing?" 
he 
asked. 
She closed 
her book, using her thumb to keep her place. 
"Why?" 
"They haven't told you?" 
"Told me what?" 
" You've been adopted. You're being picked up after 
breakfas
t . " 
She just sat there on the edge o f the bed, staring 
at 
Fergussen's broad white T-shirt. 

"Jolene, " she said, "I can ' t find my book." 
" What book?" Jolene said sleepily. It was just before 
lights 
out. 

"Modern Chess Openings, 

with a red 
cover. 
I keep it in 

my nightstand. " 
Jolene 
shook her head. " Beats the shit out of me. " 
Beth hadn't looked at the book for weeks, but she 
clearly 
remembered 
putting 
it at the bottom of the second 
drawer. She 
had a brown nylon valise beside her 
on the bed; 
it was packed with her three dresses 
and four sets of 
underwear, 
her toothbr
ush, comb, a bar of Dial soap, two 
barrettes 
and some plain cotton 
handkerchief
s . Her nightÂ­
stand was now completely 
empty. She had looked in the 
library for her book, but it 
wasn't there. There was noÂ­
where else to look. She had not played a game of chess in 
three years except 
in her mind, 
was the only thing she owned 
that she cared about. 
She squinted at Jolene. 
" You didn't see it, did you?" 

but Modern Chess Openings 

5 9 

WALTER TEVIS 

Jolene 
looked angry for a moment. 
"Watch who you go 
accusing, " she said. "I 
got no use for a book like that." 
Then her voice softened. "I hear you're leaving
. " 
"That's right. " 
Jolene laughed. "What's the matter? 
Don't want to 
go?" 
"I don't know. " 
Jolene 
slipped under the bedsheet 
and pulled 
it up over 
her shoulders. "Just say ' Yes, sir' and ' Yes, ma'am' and 
you'll do all right. 
Tell 'em you ' re grateful 
to have a 
Christian 
home like theirs 
and maybe they'll give you a 
TV in your 
room. " 
There was something 
odd about 
the way Jolene was 
talking. 
"Jolene , " Beth 
said, "I'm sorry . " 
" Sorry about what?" 
"I'm sorry you didn' t get adopted. " 
Jolene 
snorted. " Shit , " she said, " I make out fine right 
here . " She rolled 
over away from Beth and curled 
up in 
bed. Beth started 
to reach 
out toward her, but 
just then 
Miss Furth stepped 
in the doorway 
and said, "Lights out, 
girls! " Beth went 
back to her bed, for the laï¿½t time. 
The next day Mrs. Deardorff went with them 
out to the 
parking lot 
and stood by the car while Mr. Wheatley got 
into the driver's seat and Mrs. Wheatley 
and Beth got into 
the back. "Be a good girl, Elizabeth, " Mrs. Deardorff 
said. 
Beth nodded 
and as she did 
so saw that someone was 
standing 
behind Mrs. Deardorff on the porch of the AdÂ­
ministration 
Building. It was Mr. Shaibel. He had his 
hands stuffed in his coverall 
pockets 
and was looking 
toward the car. She wanted to get out and go over to him, 

60 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

but Mrs. Deardorff was in the way, so she leaned back in 
her seat. Mrs. Wheatley 
began talking, 
and Mr. Wheatley 
started the car. 
As they pulled 
out, Beth twisted 
around in her seat and 
waved out the back window at him, but he made no 
response. She could 
not tell for sure if 
he had seen her or 
not. 

" You should 
have seen their faces, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said. 
She was 
wearing 
the same blue cardigan, but this time she 
had a faded gray dress under it, and her nylons 
were rolled 
down to her ankles. 
' 'They looked in all my closets 
and 
even inspected the refrigerato
r. I could see immediately 
that they were 
impressed 
with my provisions. Have some 
more of the tuna casserole. I certainly 
enjoy watching 
a 
young child eat. " 
Beth put a little 
more on her plate. 
The problem 
was 
that it was too salty, 
but she hadn't said anything 
about 
that. It was her first meal 
at the Wheatleys
' . Mr. Wheatley 
had already 
left for Denver 
on business 
and would be away 
for several 
weeks. A photograph 
of him sat 
on the upright 
piano by the heavily 
draped dining-room 
window. In the 
living 
room the TV was playing 
unattended
; a deep male 
voice was declaiming 
about Anacin. 
Mr. Wheatley had driven 
them to Lexington 
in silence 
and 
then gone immediately upstairs
. He came down after a few 
minutes 
with a 
suitcase, 
kissed 
Mrs. Wheatley 
distractedly 
on the cheek, 
nodded a goodbye 
to Beth and left. 
' 'They wanted 
to know everything 
about us. How much 
money Allston makes a month. Why we have no 
children 
of our own. They even 
inquired"-Mrs. Wheatley 
bent 
forward over the Pyrex dish and spoke in a stage whisper
-

6 1 

WALTER TEVIS 

"they even 
inquired if I had been in psychiatric care . " She 
leaned back 
and let out 
her breath. " Can you imagine? 
Can you 
imagine? ' ' 
"No, ma'am , " Beth said, filling i n the sudden silence
. 
She took another 
forkful of tuna and followed it with a 
drink of water. 
"They are 
thorough," Mrs. Wheatley 
said. "But, you 
know, I suppose 
they have 
to be.' ' She had not touched 
anything 
on her plate. During the two 
hours since they 
arrived
, Mrs. Wheatley 
had spent 
the time jumping 
up 
from whatever 
chair she was sitting 
in and going to 
check 
the oven or 
adjust one of the Rosa Bonheur 
prints 
on the 
walls , or empty 
her ashtray. She chattered 
almost conÂ­
stantly 
while Beth put in an occasional 
" Yes, ma'am" or 
"No, ma'am ." Beth had not 
yet been shown her room; 
her brown nylon bag still 
sat by the front door next to the 
overflowing magazine 
rack where she had left it at tenÂ­
thirty 
that morning. 
"God knows, " Mrs . Wheatley 
was saying, 
"God knows 
they have to be 
meticulous 
about whom they turn their 
charges 
over to. You can ' t have scoundrels 
taking the 
responsibility 
for a growing 
child.' ' 
Beth set her fork down carefully. ' ' May I go 
to the 
bathroom, please?" 
' 'Why , certainly . ' ' She point
ed to the living 
room with 
her fork. Mrs . Wheatley 
had been 
hoJding the fork all 
during lunch, even though she had 
eaten nothing. "The 
white door to the left of 
the sofa.' ' 
Beth got up, squeezed 
past the piano that practically 
filled the small dining 
room and 
went into the 
living 
room 
and through 
its clutter of coffee table and lamp tables 
and 
huge rosewood 
TV, now showing 
an afternoon drama. She 

62 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

walked carefully across 
the Orion shag carpet 
and into the 
bathroom. The bathroom 
was tiny and completely 
done in 
robin's-egg blue-the same shade 
as Mrs . 
Wheatley
's carÂ­
digan. It had a blue carpet 
and little blue guest towels 
and 
a blue toilet seat. 
Even the toilet 
paper was blue. Beth 
lifted the toilet 
seat, vomited the tunafish 
into the bowl and 
flushed 
it. 

When they 
got to the top of the stairs Mrs . 
Wheatley 
rested 
for a moment, leaning 
her hip against 
the banister 
and breathing 
heavily. Then she took a few steps along the 
carpeted 
hallway 
and dramatically 
pushed a door open. 
"This, " she said, "will be your room. " Since it was a 
small house, 
Beth had 
visualized 
something 
tiny for herÂ­
self, but when she walked in she caught her breath . 
It 
looked enormous 
to her. The floor was bare and painted 
gray, with a pink oval rug at the side of the double bed. 
She had never had a room of her own before. She stood, 
holding 
her valise, and looked around her. There was a 
dresser, 
and a desk whose orange-looking 
wood matched 
it, with a pink glass lamp on it, and a pink chenille 
bedspread 
on the enormous 
bed. " You have no idea how 
difficult it is to find good maple furniture
, " Mrs. Wheatley 
was saying, 
"but I think I did very well, if I do say so 
myself." Beth hardly heard 
her. This room was hers . She 
looked at the heavily 
painted white 
door; there was a key 
in it, under the knob. She could lock the door and no one 
could come in. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
showed her where the bathroom 
was 
down the hall and then left her alone to unpack, closing 
the door 
behind her. Beth set down her bag and 
walked 
around, stopping 
only briefly 
to look out each of the win-

63 

WALTER TEVIS 

dows at the tree-lined 
street 
below. There was a closet, 
bigger than Mother's had been, and a nightstand 
by the 
bed, with a little 
reading 
lamp. It was a beautiful 
room. If 
only Jolene 
could see it. For a moment she felt like crying 
for Jolene, 
she wanted Jolene 
to be there, 
going around the 
room with her while 
they looked at all the 
furniture 
and 
then hung Beth
's clothes 
in the closet. 
In the car Mrs. Wheatley 
had said how glad they were 
to have an older child. Then why not adopt 
Jolene? 
Beth 
had thought. 
But she said 
nothing. 
She looked at Mr. 
Wheatley 
with his grim-set 
jaw and his two pale hands on 
the steering 
wheel and then at Mrs. Wheatley 
and she 
knew they would never have adopted 
Jolene. 
Beth sat on the bed and 
shook off the 
memory. It was a 
wonderfully soft bed, and it smelled 
clean and fresh. 
She 
bent over and pulled off 
her shoes and 
lay back, stretching 
out on its great, 
comforting 
expanse, 
turning her head 
happily 
to look over at the tightly 
closed 
door that gave her 
this room entirely 
to herself. 
She lay awake for several 
hours that night, 
not wanting 
to go to sleep right away. There was a streetlight 
outside 
her windows, 
but they had good, heavy shades that she 
could pull down to block it out. Before saying 
goodnight, 
Mrs. Wheatley 
had shown 
Beth her own room. It was on 
the other 
side of the 
hall and exactly 
the same size as 
Beth ' s , but it had a television 
set in it 
and chairs 
with 
slipcovers 
and a blue coverlet 
on the bed. "It's really 
a 
remodeled 
attic, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said. 
Lying in bed, 
Beth could hear the distant 
sound of Mrs. 
Wheatley 
coughing 
and later she heard her bare feet padÂ­
ding down 
the hallway 
to the bathroom . But she didn' t 
mind. Her own door was closed 
and locked. N o one could 

64 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

push it 
open and let the light fall on her face. Mrs. 
Wheatley 
was alone 
in her own room, and there would be 
no sounds of talking 
or quarreling-only music and low 
synthetic 
voices 
from the television 
set. It would be wonÂ­
derful 
to have Jolene 
there, but then she woul
dn' t have the 
room to herself, 
wouldn't be able to lie alone in this 
huge 
bed, stretched 
out in the middle of it, having the cool 
sheets 
and now the silence 
to herself. 

On Monday she went to school. Mrs. Wheatley 
took her in 
a taxi, even though it was 
less than 
a mile. Beth went 
into 
seventh 
grade. It was a lot like the public 
high school 
in 
that other town where she had done the chess exhibition, 
and she knew her clothes 
weren't right, 
but no one paid 
much attention 
to her. A few of the other students 
stared 
for a minute when the teacher 
introduced 
her to the class, 
but that was it. She was 
given books and assigned 
to a 
home room. From the books and what the teachers said 
in 
class she 
knew it would be easy. She recoiled 
a bit at the 
loud noises 
in the hallways 
between 
classes
, and felt selfÂ­
conscious 
a few times 
when other students 
looked at her, 
but it was not difficult. She felt she could deal with 
anything that 
might come up in this sunny, noisy public 
school. 
At lunchtime 
she tried to sit 
alone in the cafeteria 
with 
her ham sandwich and 
carton of milk, but another 
girl 
came and 
sat across 
from her. Neither 
of them spoke for a 
while. The other girl was plain, like 
Beth. 
When she had finished 
half her sandwich 
Beth looked 
across 
the table 
at her. " Is there a school chess 
club?" 
she 
asked. 
The other girl looked up, startled. " What?" 

65 

WALTER TEVIS 

" Do they have a chess 
club? I want to 
join. " 
" Oh , " the girl said. " I don' t think they have anything 
like that. You can try out for junior 
cheerleader
. " 
Beth finished 
her sandwich
. 

" You certainly 
spend a lot of time at your studies
, " Mrs . 
Wheatley 
said. "Don't you have any hobbies?" Actually, 
Beth was not studying; 
she was reading 
a novel from the 
school 
library. She was sitting 
in the armchair 
in her room, 
by the window. 
Mrs . Wheatley had 
knocked and 
then 
come in, wearing 
a pink 
chenille 
bathrobe 
and pink satin 
slippers. She walked over and sat on the edge of Beth's 
bed, smiling 
at her distractedly, as though she were thinkÂ­
ing about something 
else. Beth had 
lived with her a week 
now and she noticed 
that Mrs. Wheatley 
was often that 
way. 
"I used to play chess, " Beth said. 
Mrs . Wheatley 
blinked. 
"Chess?" 
"I like 
it a lot." 
Mrs . Wheatley shook 
her head as though shaking 
someÂ­
thing out of her hair. "Oh, chess! " she said. "The royal 
game. How nice.' ' 
"Do you play?" Beth said. 
"Oh, Lord, no! " Mrs. Wheatley 
said with a selfÂ­
deprecating 
laugh. 
" I haven' t the mind for it. But 
my 
father used to play. My father was a surgeon and quite 
refined 
in his ways; I believe 
he was a superior 
chess 
player in 
his time . " 
' 'Could I play chess with 
him?' ' 
' 'Hardly,' ' Mrs. Wheatley 
said. ' 'My father 
passed on 
years ago . ' ' 
" Is there anyone I could play with?" 

66 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

"Play chess? 
I have no idea . " Mrs. Wheatley 
peered at 
her for a moment. "Isn't 
it primarily 
a game for boys?" 
"Girls play , " she said. 
"How nice! " But Mrs . Wheatley 
was clearly 
miles 
away. 

Mrs . Wheatley 
spent two days getting 
the house cleaned 
for Miss Farley, and she sent Beth to brush her hair three 
times on the morning 
of the visit. 
When Miss Farley came in the door she was 
followed 
by a tall man wearing 
a football 
jacket. 
Beth was shocked 
to see it was Fergussen. He looked mildly 
embarrassed. 
" Hi there, 
Harmon, " he said. "I invited myself along. " 
He walked into Mrs. Wheatley
's living 
room and stood 
there with his 
hands in his pockets. 
Miss Farley had a set of forms and a check list. 
She 
wanted to know about 
Beth's diet and her schoolwork and 
what plans she had for 
the summer. 
Mrs . Wheatley 
did 
most of the talking. Beth could see her 
become more 
expansive 
with each question
. "You can have no 
idea, " 
Mrs . Wheatley 
said, "of how marvelously 
well Beth has 
adjusted to the school environment. 
Her teachers 
have 
been immensely 
impressed 
with her work . . . ' ' 
Beth could not remember 
any conversations 
between 
Mrs. Wheatley 
and the teachers 
at school, but she said 
nothing. 
"I had hoped to see Mr. Wheatley, too," Miss Farley 
said. "Will he be here soon?" 
Mrs. Wheatley 
smiled 
at her. "Allston called 
earlier to 
say he was terribly sorry, but he couldn't come. He's 
really 
been working 
so hard . " She looked over at Beth, 
still 
smiling. 
"Allston is a marvelous 
provider
. " 

67 

WALTER TEVIS 

"Is he able to spend much time with Beth?" Miss 
Farley 
said. 
" Why , of course! " Mrs. Wheatley 
said. "Allston is a 
wonderful father to 
her. ' ' 
Shocked, Beth looked down at her hands. Not even 
Jolene 
could lie 
so well. For a moment she had believed 
it 
herself, 
had seen an image of a helpful, fatherly 
Allston 
Wheatley-an Allston 
Wheatley 
who did not exist 
outside 
of Mrs. Wheatley
' s words. But then she remembered 
the 
real one, grim, distant and silent. And there had been no 
call from him. 
During the hour they were there, Fergussen said almost 
nothing. When they 
got up to leave, he held out his hand 
to Beth and her heart sank. "Good to see 
you, Harmon, " 
he said. She took his hand to 
shake it, wishing 
that he 
could stay behind somehow, 
to be with her. 

A few days later Mrs. Wheatley 
took her downtown to 
shop for clothes
. When the 
bus stopped 
at their comer, 
Beth stepped 
into it without 
hesitati
on, even though it was 
the first 
time she'd ever been on a bus. Ir was a warm fall 
Saturday, and Beth was 
uncomfortable 
in her 
Methuen 
wool skirt and could hardly wait to get a new one. She 
began to count the blocks 
to downtown. 
They got off at the seventeenth 
corner. 
Mrs . Wheatley 
took her hand, although 
it was hardly neceasary
, and 
ushered 
her across 
a few yards of busy sidewalks 
into the 
revolving 
doors of Ben Snyder's Department 
Store. It was 
ten in the 
morning and the 
aisles 
were full of women 
carrying big dark purses 
and shopping 
bags. Mrs. Wheatley 
walked through the crowd 
with the sureness 
of an expert. 
Beth followed. 

68 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

Before they looked at anything 
to wear, Mrs. Wheatley 
took her down the broad stairs 
to the basemen
t, where she 
spent twenty minutes at a counter 
with what a card said 
were "Dinner Napkin Irregulars
, " putting 
together 
six 
blue ones from the multicol
ored pile, rejecting 
dozens in 
the process. She waited while Mrs. Wheatley 
assembled 
her set in a kind of mesmerized 
trial and error and then 
decided 
she didn't really 
need napkins. They went to 
another counter 
with "Book Bargains" on it. Mrs. Wheatley 
read out the titles 
of a great many thirty-nine-cent 
books, 
picked up several 
and leafed 
through 
them but didn't buy 
any. 
Finally 
they took the 
escalator 
back to the main floor. 
There they stopped 
at a perfume 
counter 
so Mrs. Wheatley 
could spray one wrist with Evening 
in Paris and the other 
with Emeraude. " All right. 
dear," Mrs . Wheatley 
said 
finally, 
"we'll 
go up to four. " She smiled 
at Beth. "Young 
Ladies' 
Ready-to-Wear
. " 
Between 
the third and fourth floors 
Beth looked back 
and saw a sign on a counter 
and right near the sign, on a glass-topped 
counter, 
were 
three chess sets. "Chess! " she said, tugging 
Mrs. Wheatley's 
sleeve. 
" What is it?" Mrs . Wheatley 
said, clearly 
annoyed. 
' 'They sell chess sets , ' ' Beth said. ' 'Can we go back?
' ' 
"Not so Loud," Mrs . Wheatley 
said. "We'll go by on 
the way back 
down .' ' 
But they didn't. Mrs. Wheatley 
spent the rest of 
the 
morning having 
Beth try on coats from marked-down 
racks 
and tum 
around to 
show her the hemline 
and go over near 
the window so she could see the fabric by â¢ 'natural light , ' ' 

that said BOOKS AND GAMES, 

69 

WALTER TEVIS 

and finally buying one and insisting they 
go down by 
elevator. 
" Aren't we going to look at the chess sets?" Beth said
, 
but Mrs. Wheatley 
didn't answer. 
Beth' s feet hurt, 
and she 
was perspir
ing. She did not like the coat she was carrying 
in a cardboard 
box. It was the same robin's-egg blue as 
Mrs . Wheatley's omnipresent 
sweater, 
and it didn't fit. 
Beth did not 
know much 
about clothes, 
but she could tell 
that this store sold cheap ones. 
When the elevator 
stopped 
at the third floor, 
Beth started 
to remind her about the chess sets, but the 
door closed 
and 
they went down to the main floor. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
took 
Beth's hand and led her across 
the street 
to the 
bus stop, 
complaining 
about the difficulty 
of finding 
anything 
these 
days. " But after all, " she said philosophically 
as the 
bus 
drew up 
to the 
corner, "we got what we came for. " 
The next week in English 
class some girls behind Beth 
were talking 
before the teacher 
came in. "Did you get 
those shoes at Ben Snyder's or 
something?" one of them 
said. 
" I wouldn't be caught 
dead in Ben Snyder's , " the other 
girl said, laughing. 

Beth walked to school 
every morning, along shady 
streets 
of quiet houses with trees on their lawns. Other students 
went the 
same way, and Beth recognized 
some of them, 
but she 
always walked alone. She had enrolled 
two weeks 
late in the fall term, and 
after her fourth 
week, mid-term 
exams began. On Tuesday she had 
no tests in the morning 
and was 
supposed 
to go to her home room. Instead she 
took the bus downtown, carrying her notebook 
and the 

70 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

forty cents she had saved 
from her quarter-a-week 
allowÂ­
ance. She had her change ready when she got on the bus. 
The chess sets 
were still on the counter, 
but up close she 
could see that 
they weren't very good. When she picked 
up the white queen she was surprised 
at how light it 
was. 
She turned it over. It was hollow inside 
and made of 
plastic
. She put 
it back as 
the saleswoman 
came up and 
said, "May I help you?" 

"Do you have Modern Chess Openings?" 

"We have chess and checkers 
and backgammon
, " the 
woman said, "and a variety 
of children' s games. " 
"It's 
a book, " Beth said, "about chess. " 
"The book department is across 
the aisle. " 
Beth went to the bookshelves 
and began looking 
through 
them. There 
was nothing 
about chess. There was no clerk 
to ask, either. 
She went back to the woman at the counter 
and had to wait a long time to get her attention. ' ' I' m 
trying 
to find a book about chess, " Beth told her. 
"We don't handle 
books in this department," the woman 
said and started 
to turn away again. 
" Is there a bookstore near here?'' Beth asked quickly. 
' 'Try Morris'. ' ' She went over 
to a stack of boxes and 
began straightening 
them. 
"Where is it?" 
The woman said nothing. 
"Where's Morris', ma' am?" Beth said loudly. 
Â·
The 
woman turned and looked at her 
furiously. "On 
Upper Street, " she said. 
"Where's Upper Street?" 
The woman looked for a moment as if she would scream. 
Then her face relaxed 
and she said, "Two blocks 
up 
Main. " 

7 1 

WALTER TEVIS 

Beth took the escalators 
down. 

Morris' was on a corner, next 
to a drugstore. 
Beth pushed 
open the door and found herself 
in a big room 
full of more 
books than 
she had ever seen in 
her life. 
There was a bald 
man sitting 
on a stool behind a counter, smoking 
a cigaÂ­
rette and reading. Beth walked up to him and said, "Do 

you have Modern Chess Openings?" 

The man turned from his book and peered at her over 
his glasses
. "That's an odd one , " he said in a pleasant 
voice. 
"Do you have it?" 
"I think 
so." He got up from the stool and walked to 
the rear of the store. A minute later he came 
back to Beth, 
carrying 
it in his hand. It was 
the same fat book with the 
same red cover. 
She caught her breath 
when she saw it. 
' 'Here you go, ' ' the man said, handing 
it to her. 
She 
took it and opened it to the art on the Sicili
an Defense. It 
was good to see 
the names of the variations 
again; 
the 
Levenfish, the Dragon, the Najdorf. They 
were like incanÂ­
tations 
in her 
head, or the names of saints. 
After a while she heard the 
man speaking 
to her. "Are 
you that 
serious 
about chess?' ' 
" Yes , " she said. 
He smiled. "I thought 
that book was only for grandÂ­
masters . ' ' 
Beth hesitated. 
"What's a grandmaster?" 
"A genius 
player , " the man said. " Like Capablanca, 
except that was a long time 
ago. There are others 
nowaÂ­
days, but I don't know their names. " 
She had never 
seen anyone quite like this man 
before. 
He was very relaxed, and he talked 
to her as though she 

72 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

were another 
adult. 
Fergussen was the closest 
thing to 
him, but Fergussen was sometimes 
very official. " How 
much is the book?" Beth asked. 
"Pretty much. Five ninety-f
ive . " 
She had been afraid it would 
be something 
like that. 
After today' s two bus fares she would have ten cents left . 
She held the book out to him and said, "Thank you. I 
can't afford it. " 
" Sorry , " he said. "Just put it on the counter. " 
She set it down. "Do you have other books 
about 
chess?" 
" Sure. Under Games and 
Sports. Go take a 
look . " 
At the back of the store was a whole shelf o f them with 
titles 

like Paul Morphy and the Golden Age of Chess; 
Winning Chess Traps; How to Improve Your Chess; ImÂ­
proved Chess Strategy
Attack 
and Counterattack 

. She took down one called 
in Chess and began reading the games, 
picturing 
them in her mind without 
reading the diagrams . 
She stood there for a long time while a few customers 
went in and out of the store. No one bothered 
her. She read 
through game 
after game and was 
surprised 
in some of 
them by dazzling 
moves--queen 
sacrifices 
and smothered 
mates. There were sixty games, and each had a title at 
the 
top of the page, like 
" V . Smyslov-1 . Rudakavsky: 
MosÂ­
cow 1 945" or "A. Rubinstein--0
. Duras: 
Vienna 1 908 ." In 
that one, White queened 
a pawn on the thirty-sixth move 
by threatening a discovered 
check. 
Beth looked at the cover of the book. It was smaller 
than Modern Chess Openings and there was a sticker 
on 
it that said $2.95 . She began going through it systematical
ly. 
The clock on the bookstore wall read ten-thi
rty. She would 
have to leave in an hour 
to get to school 
for the History 

73 

WALTER TEVIS 

exam. Up front the clerk was paying no attention 
to her, 
absorbed 
in his own 
reading. She began 
concentrating, and 
by eleven-t
hirty she had twelve of 
the games memorized
. 
On the bus back to school 
she began playing 
them over 
in her head. Behind some of 
the moves-not 
the glamorÂ­
ous ones 
like the queen sacrifices but 
sometimes 
only in 
the one-squa
re advance 
of a pawn-she could see subtleÂ­
ties that made the small hairs on the 
back of her neck 
tingle. 
She was five minutes 
late for the test, but no one 
seemed to care and she finished 
before everyone 
else 
anyway. 
In the twenty minutes 
until the end of the period 
she played "P. Keres-A . 
Tarnowski: 
Helsinki 
1 952 . " It 
was the Ruy Lopez Opening 
where White brought 
the 
bishop 
out in a way that Beth could see meant an indirect 
attack 
on Black's king pawn. On the thirty-f
ifth move 
White brought 
his rook down to the knight 
seven square in 
a shocking 
way that made Beth almost 
cry out in her 
seat. 

Fairfield Junior 
High had social 
clubs that met for an hour 
after school 
and sometimes 
during 
home-room period 
on 
Fridays. There was the Apple Pi Club and the Sub Debs 
and Girls Around Town. They were like sororities 
at a 
college, 
and you had to be pledged. 
The girls in Apple 
Pi 
were eighth 
and ninth graders; 
most of them wore bright 
cashmere sweaters and fashionably 
scuffed saddle 
oxfords 
with argyle 
socks. Some of them lived in the country and 
owned horses. Thoro
ughbreds. Girls like that never looked 
at you in 
the hallways; 
they were always 
smiling 
at someÂ­
one else. Their sweaters 
were bright 
yellow 
and deep blue 
and pastel 
green. Their socks came up to just below the 

74 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

knees and were made 
of l 00 percent 
virgin 
wool from 
England. 
Sometimes 
when Beth 
saw herself 
in the mirror of the 
girls' room 
between 
classes, with her straight 
brown hair 
and narrow shoulders and round face with dull brown eyes 
and freckles 
across the 
bridge 
of her 
nose, she would taste 
the old taste of 
vinegar in her mouth. The girls who 
belonged 
to the 
clubs wore lipstick 
and eye shadow; 
Beth 
wore no makeup and her hair still 
fell over her forehead in 
bangs. It did not occur to her that she 
would be pledged 
to 
a club, nor did it to anyone else. 

"This week , " Mrs . MacArthur 
said, "we will begin to 
study the binomial 
theorem. Does anyone know what a 
binomial 
is? ' ' 
From the back row Beth put up her hand. I t was the first 
time she had done this. 
" Yes?" Mrs. MacArthur 
said. 
Beth stood, feeling suddenly 
awkward. " A binomial 
is 
a mathematical 
expression 
containing 
two terms. " They 
had studied 
this last 
year at Methuen. "X plus Y is a 
binomial
. ' ' 
"Very good," Mrs. MacArthur 
said. 
The girl in front of Beth was named Margaret; she had 
glowing blond 
hair and wore a cashmere sweater 
of a 
pale, expensive 
lavender. 
As Beth sat down, the blond 
head turned 
slightly 
back toward her. ' 'Brain!'' Margaret 
hissed. 

' 'Goddamn brain!' ' 

Beth was always alone in the halls; it hardly 
occurred to 
her that there was any other way to be . Most girls walked 
in pairs or in threes, but she walked with no one. 

75 

WALTER TEVIS 

One afternoon when she was coming out of the library 
she was 
startled 
by the sound of distant laughter 
and 
looked down 
the hall to see, haloed by afternoon sunlight, 
the back of a tall black girl. Two shorter 
girls were standÂ­
ing near her, by the water fountain, looking 
up at her face 
as she laughed. None of 
their features 
was distinct, 
and the 
light from behind them made 
Beth squint. 
The taller 
girl 
turned slightly
, and Beth's heart almost stopped 
at the 
familiar tilt of her head. Beth took a quick dozen 
steps 
down the hallway toward 
them. 
But it wasn't Jolene. 
Beth stopped 
suddenly 
and turned 
away. The three girls left the fountain 
and pushed noisily 
out the front door of the building
. Beth stood staring 
after 
them for a long time. 

"Could you go to Bradley's and get 
me some cigs?" Mrs . 
Wheatley 
said. " I think I 
have a cold . " 
" Yes, ma'am , " Beth said. It was Saturday afternoon 
and Beth was holding 
a novel in her lap, but she wasn't 
reading it. She was playing 
over a game between 
P. 
Morphy and someone 
called simply 
"grandmaster
. " There 
was something 
peculiar 
about Morphy' s eighteenth 
move, 
of knight to 
bishop 
five. It was a good attack, 
but Beth felt 
Morphy could have been 
more destructive 
with his 
queen's 
rook. 
"I'll give you a note, since you're a bit youthful 
for 
smoking 
yourself.
' ' 
" Yes, ma' am , " Beth said. 
"Three packs of Chesterfields. " 
" Yes, ma'am ." 
She had been in Bradley's only once before, with 
Mrs. 
Wheatley
. Mrs. Wheatley 
gave her a penciled 
note and a 

76 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

cover of Time and Newsweek: 

dollar 
and twenty cents. Beth handed the note 
to Mr. 
Bradley 
at the counter. 
There was a long rack of magaÂ­
zines behind 
her. When she 
got the cigarettes, she turned 
and began looking. 
Senator 
Kennedy' s picture was 
on the 
he was running 
for President 
and probably 
wouldn't make it because 
he was a Catholic. 
There was a row of women' s magazines 
that all had 
faces on their covers like the faces of Margaret 
and Sue 
Ann and the other Apple Pi' s . Their hair shone; their 
lips 
were full and red. 
She had just decided 
to leave when something 
caught 
her eye. At the lower right-hand 
corner, 
where the magaÂ­
zines about photography 
and sunbathing 
and do-it-yourself 
were, was a magazine 
with a picture of a chess piece 
on its 
cover. 
She walked over 
and took it from the rack. On the 
cover was the title, 
price. She 
opened it. 
It was full of games and photographs 
of people 
playing 
chess. There was an article 
called 
"The King's 
Gambit Reconsidered" 
and another 
one called 
" Morphy' s 
Brillia
ncies. " She had just been going over one o f Morphy's 
games! Her heart began beating 
faster. 
She kept going 
through 
the pages. There was an article about chess in 
Russia. And the thing that kept turning up was the word 
' 'tournament
. ' ' There was a whole section 
called 
' 'TourÂ­
nament Life . " She had not known there 
was such a thing 
as a chess tournament. 
She thought chess 
was just someÂ­
thing you did, the way 
Mrs. Wheatley hooked 
rugs and put 
together 
j igsaw puzzles. 
"Young lady," Mr. Bradley said
, "you have to buy the 
magazine 
or put it back. " 
. "Can' t I just . . ?" 
She turned, startled
" Read the sign , " Mr. Bradley 
said. 

Chess Review, and the 

77 

WALTER TEVIS 
In front of her was a hand-lettered 
sign: If You WANT 
TO READ IT-BUY IT. Beth had fifteen 
cents and that was 
all. Mrs . 
Wheatley 
had told her a few days before 
that she 
would have to do without 
an allowance for 
a while; 
they 
were rather 
short and Mr. Wheatley 
had been delayed 
out 
West. Beth put the magazine back 
and left the store. 
Halfway back up the block she stopped, thought a 
moÂ­
ment and went back. There was a stack of newspapers on 
the counter, 
by Mr. Bradley's elbow. She handed him a 
dime and took one. Mr. Bradley was 
busy with a 
lady who 
was paying 
for a prescription. Beth went over to the end of 
the magazine 
rack with her paper under her arm and 
waited. 
After a few minutes 
Mr. Bradley 
said, "We have three 
sizes. " She heard him going to the back of the store with 
the lady following. 
Beth took the copy 
and slipped 
it into her newspaper. 
Outside 
in the sunshine 
she walked a block with the 
paper under her arm. At the first 
comer she stopped, 
took 
out the magazine 
and slipped it under 
the waistband 
of her 
skirt, 
covering 
it with her robin 's-egg-blue 
sweater, 
made 
of reprocessed 
wool and bought at Ben Snyder's . She 
pulled 
the sweater 
down loosely 
over the magazine 
and 
dropped 
the newspaper into 
the comer trash can. 
Walking 
home with the 
folded magazine 
tucked securely 
against 
her flat belly 
she thought 
again about that rook 
move Morphy 
hadn't made. The magazine 
said Morphy 
was ' 'perhaps 
the most brilliant 
player 
in the history of the 
game. " The rook could come to bishop seven, and Black 
had better 
not take it with his 
knight 
because 
. . . She 
stopped , halfway down the block. 
A dog was barking 
somewhere
, and across the street 
from her on a well-

mowed lawn 
two small boys were loudly playing 
tag. 
After the second 
pawn moved to king knight 
five, then the 
remaining rook 
could slide over, and if the black player 
took the pawn, the bishop 
could uncover, and if 
he didn't . . . 
She closed 
her eyes. If he dido 't capture 
it, Morphy could 
force a mate in two, starting 
with the bishop 
sacrificing 
itself 
with a check. 
If he did take it, 
the white pawn moved 
again, 
and then the 
bishop went the other way and there 
was nothing 
Black could do. There it was. One of the little 
boys across the street 
Black could do. The game would be over in twenty-nine 
moves at most. The way it was in the book, it had taken 
Paul Morphy thirty-six 
moves to win. He hadn't seen the

began crying. There was nothing 

rook. But she had. 

"Allston should 
have returned 
weeks ago , " Mrs. Wheatley 
was saying. She was sitting 
up in bed, with a crosswordÂ­
puzzle magazine 
beside her and a little TV set on the 
dresser 
with the sound turned 
down. Beth had just brought 
her a cup of instant 
coffee from the kitchen. Mrs. Wheatley 
was wearing 
her pink robe and her 
face was covered 
with 
powder. 
" Will he be back soon?" 
Beth said. She didn
't really 
want to talk 
with Mrs. Wheatley; she 
wanted to 
get back to 

Chess Review. 

"He has been unavoidably 
detained
, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said. 

79 

WALTER TEVIS 

Beth nodded. 
Then she said, "I'd like to get a job for 
after school. ' ' 
Mrs. Wheatley 
blinked 
at her. " A job?" 
" Maybe I could work in a store, or wash dishes 
somewhere . ' ' 
Mrs . Wheatley 
stared at her for a long time 
before 
speaking. " At thirteen years 
of age?" she said 
finally. She 
blew her nose quietly 
on a tissue 
and folded it. "I 
should 
think you are well 
provided 
for." 
' 'I'd like to make some 
money.' ' 
"To buy clothes 
with, I suspect
. " 
Beth said nothing. 
"The only girls of your age who work , " Mrs. Wheatley 
said, " are colored. " The way 
she said "colored" 
made 
Beth decide 
to say 
nothing 
further 
about it. 
To join the United States Chess Federation 
cost six 
dollars. Another 
four dollars got you 
a subscription 
to the 
magazine. 
There was something 
even more interesting: 
in 
the section 
called 
"Tournament 
Life " there were numÂ­
bered regions; 
including one 
for Ohio, Illinois, 
Tennessee 
and Kentucky, and in the listing 
under it was an item that 
read: ' 'Kentucky 
State Champions
hip, Thanksgiving 
weekÂ­
end, Henry Clay High School Auditorium, Lexington, 
Fri . , Sat, Sun ., " and under this it said: " $ 1 85 in prizes. 
Entry fee: $5.00. USCF members only. " 
It would take six dolla
rs to join and five dollars to get 
into the 
tournament. 
When you took the bus down 
Main 
you passed 
Henry Clay High; it was eleven blocks 
from 
Janwell 
Drive. 
And it was five weeks until 
Thanksgiving
. 

"Can anyone say it 
verbati
m?" Mrs. MacArthur 
said. 
Beth put 
up her hand. 

80 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

"Beth?" 
She stood. " In any right triangle 
the square of the 
hypotenuse 
is equal to the sum of the 
squares 
of the other 
two sides. " She sat down. 
Margaret 
snickered and leaned toward Gordon, who sat 
beside her and sometimes 
held her hand. "That' s the 
brain! ' ' she whispered in a soft, girlish 
voice radiant 
with 
contempt. 
Gordon laughed. 
Beth looked 
out the window at 
the autumn leaves. 

" I do not know where the money goes! " Mrs. Wheatley 
said. "I have bought little 
more than trifles 
this month, 
and yet my 
hoard has been decimated. Decimated. " She 
plopped 
into the chintz-covered 
armchair 
and stared 
at the 
ceiling 
for a moment, wide-eyed, 
as if expecting 
a guilloÂ­
tine to 
fall . "I have 
paid electric 
bills 
and telephone 
bills 
and have 
bought simple, 
uncompli
cated groceri
es. I have 
denied myself 
cream for 
my morning coffee, have bought 
nothing 
whatever 
for my person, have attended 
neither the 
cinema nor the rummage sales at First Methodist, 
and yet 
I 
have seven dollars left where I 
should 
have at least twenty. 
' ' 
She laid the crumpled 
one-dollar 
bills 
on the table beside 
her, having fished 
them from her purse a few moments 
before. "We have this for ourselves 
until the end 
of 
October. 
It will scarcely 
buy chicken 
necks and porridge
. " 
"Doesn' t Methuen 
send you a check?" Beth said. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
brought 
her eyes down 
from the ceiling 
and stared 
at her. "For the first year," she said evenly. 
"As if the expenses 
of keeping 
you didn't exhaust 
it. " 
Beth knew 
that wasn't true. The check was seventy 
dollars, 
and Mrs . Wheatley 
didn' t spend that much on her. 
' 'It requires 
twenty dollars for 
us to live passably 
until 

8 1 

WALTER TEVIS 

the first of the month, " Mrs . Wheatley 
said. "I am thirÂ­
teen dollars short of that .' ' She turned her gaze 
briefly 
ceilingward and then back 
to Beth again. " I shall have to 
keep better 
records. ' ' 
"Maybe it's inflation , " Beth said, with some truth. She 
had taken 
only six, for the membership . 
"Maybe it 
is, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said, mollified. 
The problem 
was the five dollars for the entry 
fee. In 
home room, the day after Mrs . 
Wheatley
's oration 
about 
money, Beth took a sheet from her composition 
book and 
wrote a letter 
to Mr. Shaibel, Custodian, 
Methuen 
Home, 
Mount Sterling, Kentucky
. It read: 

Dear Mr. 
Shaibel
: 
There is a chess 
tournament 
here with a first 
prize of 
one hundred dollars and a second prize 
of fifty dolÂ­
lars. There are other prizes, too. It costs five dollars 
to enter it, and I don't have that. 
If you will send me the money I will pay you 
back 
ten dollars if I win any prize at all. 
Very truly yours, 
Elizabeth 
Harmon 

The next morning she took an envelope 
and a stamp from the 
cluttered desk in the living 
room while Mrs. Wheatley was 
still in bed. She put 
the letter 
in the mailbox 
on her 
way to scho
ol. 
In November she took another dollar from Mrs. Wheatley's 
purse. It had been a week since she wrote Mr. Shaibel
, 
and there had been no 
answer. 
This time, with 
part of the 
money, she bought the new

a young grandmaster 
named Benny Watts. Benny Watts 
was the United 
States Champion. 

Mrs . Wheatley seemed 
to have a good many colds. " I 
have a proclivity for viruses
, " she would say. "Or they 
for me.' ' She handed Beth a prescription to 
take to BradÂ­
ley ' s and a dime to buy herself 
a Coke. 
Mr. Bradley gave her an odd look 
when she came in, 
but he said 
nothing. She gave him the prescription 
and he 
went to 
the back of the store. Beth 
carefully avoided 
standing 
near the 
magazines. When she 
took the Chess 
Review a month before, it had been 
the only copy. He 
might have noticed 
it right away. 
Mr. Bradley brought 
back a plastic 
container with 
a 
typed label on it. He put it down on the counter 
while he 
got a white 
paper bag. Beth stared 
at the container. 
The 
pills 
in it 
were oblong and bright-
green. 

"This will be my tranquillity medicine" 
Mrs. Wheatley 
said. "McAndrews 
has decided 
I need tranquillity. " 
" Who's McAndrews?" Beth said. 
"Dr. McAndrews, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said, unscrewing 
the 
lid. "My physician
. " She took out two of the pills. "Would 
you get me a glass of water, dear?" 
" Yes, ma' am , " Beth said. As she was going into the 
bathroom 
for the water, 
Mrs . Wheatley 
sighed 
and said, 
"Why do they only fill these bottles 
half full?" 

In the November 
issue there were twenty-two 
games from 
an invitational 
tournament 
in Moscow. The players had 
names like Botvinnik 
and Petrosian 
and Laev; they sounded 
like people in a fairy tale. There 
was a photograph 
showÂ­
ing two of them hunched 
over a board, dark-hair
ed and 

83 

WALTER TEVIS 

grim-lipped. 
They wore black suits. Out of focus, behind 
them, sat 
a huge audience. 
In a game between 
Petrosian 
and someone named 
Benkowitz, 
in the 
semifinals, Beth saw a bad decision of 
Petrosian' s . He started 
an attack 
with pawns but 
shouldn't 
have. There was a commentary on the game 
by an AmeriÂ­
can grandmaster, 
who thought 
the pawn moves 
were good, 
but Beth 
saw deeper than that. How 
could Petrosian have 
misjudged it? Why hadn' t the American 
seen the 
weakÂ­
ness? They must have spent a long time studying 
it, since 
the magazine 
said the game took five 
hours. 

Margaret only 
slipped 
the shaft into her gym lock 
and 
didn't twist the dial 
afterward
. They were in shower stalls 
side by side now , and Beth could see Margaret's sizable 
breasts, like solid cones. Beth's chest was still 
like a boy's 
and her pubic hair had 
just started 
coming in. Margaret 
ignored 
Beth and hummed while 
she soaped herself. 
Beth 
stepped 
out and wrapped 
herself 
in a towel. Still 
wet, she 
went back 
into the locker 
room. There was no one there. 
Beth dried her 
hands quickly 
and very quietly 
slipped 
the shaft out of Margaret's lock, muffling it in her towel. 
Her hair dripped 
on her hands, 
but that didn' t matter; 
there 
was water all over 
from the boys' gym. Beth 
slipped 
off 
the lock and opened the locker door, slowly 
so it wouldn't 
squeak. Her heart was thumping 
like some 
kind of little 
animal in her chest. 
It was a fine brown 
purse of real leather. 
Beth dried her 
hands again 
and lifted it down from the 
shelf, 
listening 
carefully . There were 
giggles 
and shouts 
from the girls in 
the shower, 
but nothing 
else. She had made a point of 
being the 
first in, to get the stall 
nearest 
the door, and she 

84 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

had left quickly. No one else would be through 
yet. She 
opened the 
purse. 
There were colored postcards and 
a new-looking 
lipstick 
and a tortoiseshell 
comb and an 
elegant 
linen handkerÂ­
chief. 
Beth pushed through 
these with her right hand. At 
the bottom, 
in a little 
silver 
money clip, 
were bills. She 
pulled 
them out. 
Two fives. She hesitated for a moment 
and then took 
them both, together 
with the clip. She put 
the purse 
back and replaced 
the lock. 
She had left her own door shut but unlocked. She 
opened it now and slid the clipped fives 
into her algebra 
book. Then she locked 
her door, went back to the shower 
and stayed 
there washing 
herself 
until all the other girls 
had left. 
When everyone else was 
gone, Beth was still 
getting 
dressed. 
Margaret 
had not opened her purse. 
Beth sighed 
deeply , like Mrs. Wheatley . Her heart was still 
pounding. 
She got 
the money clip out of 
her algebra 
book and pushed 
it under the locker 
Margaret 
had used. It might have just 
fallen 
there from Margaret' s purse, 
and anybody could 
have taken the money. She folded 
the bills and 
put them in 
her shoe. 
Then she took her own blue plastic 
purse from 
the shelf, 
opened it and reached into 
the little 
pocket that 
held the mirror. She took out two green pills, put them in 
her mouth, went to the washstand 
and swallowed them 
down with a paper cup of water. 
Supper that night was spaghetti 
and meatballs from a 
can, with 
Jell-0 
for dessert. 
While Beth was 
doing the 
dishes 
and Mrs. Wheatley 
was in the l iving room turning 
the volume up on the 
TV, Mrs. Wheatley 
suddenly 
said, 
" Oh, I forgot. " 
Beth went 
on scrubbing 
the spaghetti 
pan and i n a

minute Mrs. Wheatley 
appeared 
with an envelope 
in her 
hand. "This came for you , " she said 
and went back to the 

Huntley-Br
inkley 
Report. 

It was a smudged enveloped 
addressed 
in pencil. She 
dried her hands 
and opened it; there 
were five 
one-dollar 
bills inside 
and no message. 
She stood at the sink for a 
long time, holding 
the bills 
in her hand. 

The green pills 
were four dollars for 
a bottle 
of fifty. The 
label read: "Three refills . " Beth paid 
with four one-dollar 
bills. 
She walked home briskly 
and put the prescription 
slip back in Mrs. Wheatley
's desk. 

86 

CHAPTER 4 

At the entrance 
to the gym a desk 
had been set up, and two 
men in white shirts were sitting 
behind it. Behind them 
were rows of long tables 
with green-and-white 
chessboar
ds. 
The room was full of people talking 
and a few playing; 
most of them were young men or boys. Beth saw one 
woman and 
no colored people. Pinned to the desk near the 
man on the 
left was a sign that read ENTRY FEES HERE. Beth 
walked up to him with her five dollars. 
"Do you have a clock?" 
the man asked .. 
' ' No . ' ' 
"We have a clock-sharing 
system, " he said. " If your 
opponent 
doesn't have one, come back to the desk. Play 
starts 
in twenty minutes . What's your rating?" 
"I don' t have a rating. " 
"Have you ever played in a tournament 
before? " 
"No." 

87 

WALTER TEVIS 

in Chess Review, 

The man pointed 
to Beth's money
. ' ' Are you sure you 
want to do this? " 
" I ' m sure." 
" We don't have a 
woman' s section
, " he said. 
She j ust stared 
at him. 
" I ' ll put you in Beginners
, " he said. 
" No , " Beth said, 
" I ' m not a beginner." 
The other young man had been watching 
them. "If 
you're an unrated player, 
you go in Beginners 
with the 
people under sixteen 
hundred, ' ' he said. 
Beth had paid little attention 
to ratings 
but she 
knew that masters had at 
least 2200. " What's the 
prize for Beginner
s?'' she said. 
' 'Twenty.' ' 
" What about 
the other section
?" 
"First prize in the Open is one hundred. " 
" Is it against 
any rule for me to be i n the Open? " 
H e shook his head. 
" Not a rule, exactly, but-" 
"Then put me in it. " Beth held 
out the bills. 
The man shrugged 
and gave Beth 
a card to fill 
out. 
' 'There are three guys out there with ratings 
over eighteen 
hundred. Beltik 
may show up, and he' s the state 
chamÂ­
pion. They' ll eat you alive." 
She took a 
ball-point 
pen and began filling 
in the card 
with her name 
and address. Where a 
blank said 
"Rating" 
she put a large zero. She handed the card back. 
They started 
twenty 
minutes 
late. It 
took them a while to 
get the pairings 
posted. 
When they were putting 
the names 
on the board Beth asked the man next to her 
if it was done 
at random. " Not at all, " he said. "They arrange it by 
ratings 
on the first round. After that, winners play winÂ­
ners, and losers, losers. "

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

When her 
card was finally 
put up it said "Harmon-Unr 
-Black . ' ' 
It was put under one that said "Packer-Unr-White. " 
The two cards were by the number Twenty-seven
. They 
turned out to be the last two
. 
She walked over to 
Board Twenty-seven 
and seated 
herself 
at the black pieces. She was at the last board on the 
farthest table. 
Sitting 
next to her was a woman of about thirty. After a 
minute, 
two more women came walking 
over. One was 
about twenty, 
and the other 
was Beth's opponent-a tall , 
heavy high school 
girl. Beth looked over the expanse 
of 
tables, where players 
were getting 
settled 
or, already 
seated, 
were beginning. 
games; all of them were male, mostly 
young. There were four female players at the tournament 
and they were 
all clumped together 
at the far end, playing 
against 
one another. 
Beth's opponent 
sat down with 
some awkwardness, put 
her two-faced chess clock at the side of the board and held 
out a hand. "I'm Annette 
Packer, " she said
. 
Her hand felt large and moist in 
Beth ' s . ' 'I ' m Beth 
Harmon, " she said. " I don't understand 
about chess 
clocks . ' ' 
Annette 
seemed relieved 
to have something 
to explain. 
"The clock face nearest 
you measures 
your playing 
time. 
Each player has 
ninety minutes. After you move, you 
press the button 
on top, 
and it stops your 
clock and starts 
your opponent
' s . There are little 
red flags over 
the number 
twelve 
on each clock face; yours will fall down when the 
ninety minutes are up. 
If it does that, you've lost . " Beth 
nodded. It seemed like a lot of time to her; she 
had never 
put more than twenty minutes 
into a chess game. There 

89 

WALTER TEVIS 

was a ruled 
sheet of paper by each player, 
for recording 
moves. 
" You can start my clock now , " Annette 
said. 
" Why do they put all the girls together?" 
Beth said. 
Annette 
raised 
her eyebrows . "They're not supposed 
to. 
But if you win, they move you up. " 
Beth reached 
out and pressed 
down the button and 
Annette's clock began 
ticking. 
Annette took 
her king's 
pawn somewhat 
nervously and moved it to king four. 
"Oh , " she said, "it's 
touch move, 
you know . " 
" What's that?" 
"Don't touch a piece unless 
you're going to move it. If 
you touch it, you 
have to move it somewhere.' ' 
"Okay , " Beth said. "Don't you push 
your button 
now?" 
" Sorry, " Annette 
said and pressed 
her button. 
Beth's 
clock started 
ticking. 
She reacl1ed 
out firmly 
and moved 
her queen bishop' s pawn to its fourth square. 
The Sicilian 
Defense. She pressed 
the button and then 
put her elbows 
on the table, 
on each side of the board, 
like the Russians 
in 
the photogra
phs. 
She began attacking 
on the eighth 
move. On the tenth 
she had one of Annette' s bishops, and on the seventeenth 
her queen. 
Annette 
had not even castled 
yet. She reached 
out and laid her king on its side when 
Beth took her queen. 
"That was quick , " she said. She sounded 
relieved 
to have 
lost. Beth looked 
at the clock faces. Annette 
had used 
thirty minutes, 
and Beth seven. Waiting 
for Annette to 
move had been the only problem. 
The next round would not be until eleven. Beth had 
recorded 
the game with Annette 
on her score sheet, 
circled 
her own name at the top as winner; 
she went now to the 
front desk and put the sheet into 
the basket 
with the sign

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

reading 
WINNERS. 
It was the 
first one there. A young man 
who looked 
like a college student came 
up as she 
was 
walking 
away and put his sheet in. Beth had already 
noticed 
that most of the people 
here wer
en' t good-loo
king. 
A lot of them had greasy 
hair and bad 
complexions; 
some 
were fat and nervous-looking. But 
this one was 
tall and 
angular 
and relaxed, and his face was open and handsome. 
He nodded amiably 
at Beth, acknowledging 
her as another 
fast player, 
and she nodded back . 
. She began 
walking 
around the room, quietly, 
looking 
at 
some of the games being played. Another 
couple finished 
theirs, and the winner went up front to tum in the record. 
She did not see any positions that looked interesting. On 
Board Number Seven, ne1 r the front of 
the room, B lack 
had a chance to win a rook by a two-move 
combination, 
and she waited for him to move the 
necessary bishop. 
But 
when the time came 
he simply exchanged 
pawns in the 
center. 
He had not seen the combinati
on. 
The tables 
began with Board Number Three rather 
than 
One. She looked around the room, at the rows of 
heads 
bowed over the boards, at the Beginners Section 
far across 
the gym. Players were 
getting 
up from their chairs 
as 
games ended. At the far side of the room was a doorway 
she hadn
' t noticed 
before. Above it was a cardboard 
sign 
saying 
"Top Boards. " Beth walked over. 
It was a smaller 
room, not much bigger than Mrs. 
Wheatley
's living room. There were two separate tables 
and a game was going on at each
. The tables 
sat in the 
center 
of the floor 
and a black velvet 
rope on wooden 
stanchions 
kept the watchers 
from getting 
too close to the 
players
. There were 
four or five people silently 
watching 
the games, most of them clustered 
around Board Number

games in Chess Review. 

One, on her left. The 
tall, good-looking 
player was one 
of 
them. 
At Board One two men 
were sitting 
in what seemed to 
be utter concentrat
ion. The clock between 
them was 
differÂ­
ent from the others Beth 
had seen; it was bigger 
and 
sturdier. 
One man was fat and 
balding 
with a darkness 
to 
his features 
like the Russians 
in the pictures
, and he wore a 
dark suit like the Russians
' . The other was much younger 
and wore a gray sweater 
over a white shirt. 
He unbuttoned 
his shirtsleeves 
and pulled 
up the sleeves 
to his elbows, 
one arm at a time, not taking 
his eyes from the board . 
Something 
in Beth's stomach 
thrilled. This was 
the real 
thing. She held her breath 
and studied 
the position 
on the 
board. It took a few moments to penetrate 
it; it was 
balanced 
and difficult, like some of the championship 
She knew it was Black's move 
because 
the indicator on his 
clock was moving, 
and just as 
she saw that knight 
to bishop 
five was what was called 
for, 
the older man reached 
out and moved his knight 
to bishop 
five. 
The good-looking 
man was leaning 
against 
the wall 
now. Beth went 
over to him and whispereq, 
' 'Who are 
they?' ' 
"Beltik and Cullen. 
Beltik' s the State Champion. " 
" Which is which?" 
Beth said. 
The tall man held a finger 
to his lips. Then he said 
softly, " Beltik' s the young one." 
That was a surprise. The Kentucky 
State Champion 
looked to be about the age of Fergussen. " Is he a 
grandmaste
r?' ' 
"He's working 
on it. He' s been a master for years. " 
" Oh , " Beth said.

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

"It takes time. You have to play grandmasters
. " 
" How much time?" Beth said. A man 
in front of them 
by the velvet 
ropes turned and stared 
at her angrily. The 
tall man shook his 
head , pursing 
his lips for 
silence
. Beth 
turned back to the ropes 
and watched 
the game. Other 
people came in and the room began to fill up. Beth held 
her place at the front. 
There was a great deal of tension 
in the middle of the 
board. Beth studied 
it for several 
minutes 
trying 
to decide 
what she would do 
if it were 
her move; but she wasn't 
certain. It was Cullen's move. She waited 
for what seemed 
an awfully long time. He sat there with his forehead 
supported by clenched 
fists, knees together 
under the taÂ­
ble, motionless. 
Beltik leaned 
back in his chair and yawned, 
looking 
amusedly 
at Cullen's bald head in front of 
him. 
Beth could see that his teeth 
were bad, with 
dark stains 
and several 
empty spaces, 
and that his neck wasn't propÂ­
erly shaved. 
Finally Cullen 
moved. He traded 
knights in 
the center. 
There were several 
fast moves and the tension 
lessened
, 
with each player 
relinquishing 
a knight 
and a bishop in 
trades. When his move came 
again he looked 
up at Beltik 
and said, "Draw?" 
"Hell, no, " Beltik 
said. He studied 
the board impaÂ­
tiently , screwed 
up his face in a way that looked funny, 
smacked a 
fist into a 
palm, and moved his rook down to 
the seventh 
rank. Beth liked the move, and she liked the 
way Beltik 
picked up his pieces 
firmly 
and set them 
down 
with a tiny graceful 
flourish. 
In five more moves Cullen 
resigned. 
He was down by 
two pawns, his 
remaining 
bishop 
was locked into 
the back 
rank, and the time on his clock was almost 
up. He toppled 

93 

WALTER TEVIS 

his king with a kind of 
elegant 
disdain, 
reached 
over and 
gave a hasty handshake to Beltik, 
stood up and stepped 
over the rope, brushing 
past Beth, and left the room. 
Beltik stood and stretched. Beth looked at him standing 
over the board with the toppled 
king, and something 
in her 
swelled 
with excitement. 
She felt goose bumps 
on her 
arms and legs. 
Beth's next game 
was with a small and bristly 
man 
named Cooke; his 
rating 
was 1 520. She printed 
it in at the 
top of the score sheet by Board Thirteen: 
"Harmon-Unr: 
Cooke-1 520 . " It was her turn to play white. 
She moved 
pawn to queen four and pressed 
Cooke's clock, 
and he 
moved instantly 
with pawn to queen four. He seemed 
wound up very tight and his eyes kept glancing 
around the 
room. He couldn' t sit still 
in his chair. 
Beth played 
fast too, picking 
up some of his impatien
ce. 
In five minutes 
they had both developed 
their piece
s, and 
Cooke started 
an attack 
on her queenside. 
She decided 
to 
ignore it and advanced 
a knight. 
He hastily 
pushed a pawn 
up, and she saw with surprise 
that she could not take the 
pawn without 
risking 
a nasty double attack. She hesitated. 
Cooke was 
pretty 
good. The 1 500 rating 
must mean someÂ­
thing, 
after all . He was better 
than Mr. Shaibel or 
Mr. 
Ganz, and 
he looked a little 
scary with his impatien
ce. She 
slid her 
rook to the bishop's home square, putting 
it below 
the oncoming 
pawn. 
Cooke surprised 
her. He picked up his queen bishop 
and 
took one of the pawns next to her king with it, checking 
her and sacrificing the piece. She stared 
at the board, 
suddenly 
unsure for a moment. 
What was he up to? Then 
she saw it. If she took, he checked 
again with a knight 
and 
picked off a bishop. It would win him the pawn and bring 

94 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

her king out. Her stomach 
was tight for a moment; 
she did 
not like being surpris
ed. It took her a minute 
to see what to 
do. She moved the king 
over but did not take the bishop. 
Cooke brought the knight down 
anyway. 
Beth traded 
the 
pawns over on the other side 
and opened the 
file for her 
rook. Cooke kept nagging 
her king 
with complicat
ions. 
She could see now 
that there was really no danger yet if 
she didn't let 
it bluff her. 
She brought the 
rook out, and 
then doubled 
up with her queen. She liked that arrangeÂ­
ment; it looked to her imagination 
like two cannons, lined 
up and ready to fire. 
In three moves she 
was able to 
fire them. Cooke seemed 
obsessed 
with the maneuvers 
he was setting 
up against 
her 
king and blind to what Beth was really 
doing. His moves 
were interest
ing, but she saw they had no solidity 
because 
he wasn't taking in the whole board. If she had been 
playing 
only to avoid checkmate
, he would have had her 
by the 
fourth move after his first check with the bishop. 
But she 
nailed 
him on the third. She felt the blood rushing 
into her face as she saw the way to fire 
her rook. She took 
her queen and brought 
it all the way 
to the last rank, 
offering it to the black 
rook that sat back 
there, not yet 
moved. Cooke stopped 
his squirming 
for a moment 
and 
looked at her face. She looked back at him. Then he 
studied 
the position
, and studied 
it. Finally 
he reached 
out 
and took her queen 
with his rook. 
Something 
in Beth wanted to jump and shout. 
But she 
held herself 
back, reached out, pushed 
her bishop over 
one 
square and 
quietly 
said, "Check ." Cooke started 
to move 
his king and stopped. Suddenly 
he saw what was going to 
happen: he was going to lose his queen and that rook he 
had just captured 
with, too. He looked 
at her. She sat 
there 

95 

WALTER TEVIS 

impassively. 
Cooke turned 
his attention 
to the board and 
studied 
it for several 
minutes, 
squirming 
in his seat and 
scowling
. Then he looked 
back to Beth and said, ' 'Draw?'' 
Beth shook 
her head. 
Cooke scow led again. " You got me. I resign. " He 
stood up and held out his 
hand. "I 
didn't see that coming 
at all. " His smile was surprisingly 
warm. 
"Thanks, " Beth said, shaking his 
hand. 
They broke for lunch and Beth got a sandwich 
and milk 
at a drugstore down the block 
from the high school; 
she ate 
it alone at the counter 
and left. 
Her third game was with an older man in a sleeveless 
sweater. 
His name was Kaplan and his rating 
was 1 694. 
She played B lack, used the Nimzo-Indian 
defense, and 
beat him in thirty-four 
moves. She might have done it 
quicker, 
but he was skillful at defending-even though 
with White a player 
should 
be on the attack. By the time 
he resigned 
she had his king exposed 
and a bishop 
about to 
be captured
, and she had two passed 
pawns. He looked 
dazed. Some other players had gathered 
around to watch. 
It was three-thirty 
when they finished. 
Kaplan had played 
with maddening 
slowness, 
and Beth had gotten 
up from 
the table for several 
moves, to walk off her energy. By the 
time she brought 
the score sheet to the desk with her name 
circled 
on it, most of the other games were over and the 
tournament 
was breaking 
up for supper. 
There would be a 
round at eight o'clock that evening, then three more on 
Saturday
. The final round would 
be on Sunday morning at 
eleven. 
Beth went to the girls' room and washed her face and 
hands; 
it was surprisingly 
how grubby her skin felt after 
three games of chess. She looked at 
herself 
in the 
mirror, 

96 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

under the harsh lights, 
and saw what she had always seen: 
the round uninteresting 
face and the 
colorless 
hair. But 
there was something 
different. The cheeks were flushed 
with color now, and her eyes looked more alive than she 
had ever seen them. For once 
in her life she liked what she 
saw in the mirror. 
Back outside 
by the front table the 
two young men who 
had registered 
her were putting 
up a notice 
on the bulletin 
board. Some players had gathered 
around it, the handsome 
one among 
them. She walked over. The lettering 
on top, 
done with a Magic 
Marker, read UNDEFEATED
. There were 
four names on the list. At the bottom was 
held her breath 
for a moment when she saw it. And 
at the 
top of the list was the name 
"You're Harmon, aren' t you?" It was the handsome 
one. 
" Yes . " 
"Keep it up, kid, " he said, smiling. 
Just then the young man 
who had tried to put her in the 
Beginners 
Section 
shouted 
from the table, "Harmon! " 
She turned. 
"Looks like you were right, 
Harmon, " he said. 

HARMON: she 

BELTIK. 

Mrs . Wheatley 
was eating 
a pot roast TV dinner with 
whipped 
potatoes 
when Beth came in. Bat Masterson 
was 
on, very loudly. " Yours is in the oven, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said. She 
was in the chintz 
chair with the aluminum 
plate 
on a tray in her 
lap . Her stockings 
were rolled 
down to the 
tops of her black pumps. 
During the 
commercial, while Beth was eating 
the carÂ­
rots from her TV 
dinner, 
Mrs. Wheatley 
asked, 
" How did 
you do, honey?" and Beth said, "I won three games. " 

97 

WALTER TEVIS 

"That's nice, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said, not taking her 
eyes 
from the elderly 
gentleman 
who was telling 
about the relief 
he had gotten 
from Haley' s M. 0. 

That evening 
Beth was on Board Six opposite 
a homely 
young man named 
Klein. His rating 
was 1 794. Some of 
the games printed 
in Chess Review were from players 
with 
lower ratings 
than that. 
Beth was White, and she played pawn to king four, 
hoping for the Sicilian
. She knew the Sicilian better 
than 
anything 
else. But Klein 
played pawn to king four and 
then fianchettoed 
his king' s bishop, 
setting 
it over in the 
corner above his castled king
. She wasn't quite sure but 
thought 
this was the kind of opening 
called 
"Irregular." 
In the middle game, things 
got complex. Beth was 
unsure what to do and decided 
to retreat 
a bishop. 
She set 
her index finger 
on the piece and immediately 
saw she had 
better 
move pawn to queen four. She reached 
over to the 
queen pawn. 
"Sorry , " Klein said. "Touch move . " 
She looked at him. 
" You have to move the bishop, " he said. 
She could see in his face he was glad to say it. He had 
probably 
seen what 
she could do if she moved the pawn. 
She shrugged 
and tried 
to act unconcerned, 
but inside 
she was feeling something 
she hadn't felt before in a chess 
game. She was frightened. She moved the bishop 
to bishop 
four, sat back and folded her hands in her lap. Her stomÂ­
ach was in a knot. She should 
have moved the pawn. 
She looked at 
Klein' s face as he studied 
the board. After 
a moment she saw a little malicious 
grin. He pushed his 

98 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

queen's pawn to the 
fifth square, punched 
his clock smartly 
and folded his 
arms across 
his chest. 
He was going to get 
one of her bishops. And abruptly 
her fear was replaced 
by anger. 
She leaned 
over the board 
and placed her cheeks against 
her palms, 
studying 
intently. 
It took her almost ten minutes, but she found it. She 
moved and sat back. 
Klein hardly seemed to notice. 
He took the 
bishop as 
she hoped he would. Beth advanced 
her queen 
rook pawn, 
way over on the other side of the board, and Klein grunted 
slightly 
but moved 
quickly, 
pushing 
the queen pawn forÂ­
ward again. Beth 
brought 
her knight over, covering 
the 
pawn's next step, and more important, 
attacking Klein' s 
rook. He moved the rook. Inside 
Beth's stomach 
someÂ­
thing was beginning 
to uncoil . Her vision 
seemed exÂ­
tremely sharp
, as though she could read the finest print 
from across 
the room. She moved the knight, 
attacking 
the 
rook again. 
Klein looked at her, annoyed. He studied 
the board and 
moved the rook, to the 
very square Beth had known, two 
moves ago, that he 
would move. She brought 
her queen 
out to bishop 
five, right above Klein' s castled 
king. 
Still 
looking 
annoyed 
and sure 
of himself, 
Klein brought 
a knight 
over to defend. Beth picked up her queen, her 
face flushing, 
and took the pawn 
in front of the 
king, 
sacrificing 
her queen. 
He stared 
and took 
the queen. There was nothing 
else he 
could do to get out of check. 
Beth brought her bishop 
out for another 
check. Klein 
interposed 
the pawn, as she knew 
he would. "That's mate 
in two , ' ' Beth said 
quietly. 

99 

WALTER TEVIS 

the UNDEFEATED list. 

Klein stared 
at her, his face furious. "What do you 
mean?" he said. 
Beth ' s voice was still 
quiet. 
"The rook comes 
over for 
the next check and then 
the knight 
mates . ' ' 
He scowled. 
" My queen-" 
" Your queen' ll be pinned, " she said, "after the king 
moves . ' ' 
He looked back to the board and stared 
at the position. 
Then he said, "Shit ! " He did not tum 
over his king or 
offer to shake 
Beth' s hand. He got up from the 
table and 
walked away, jamming 
his hands into his pockets. 
Beth took 
her pencil 
and circled 
HARMON on her score 
sheet. 
When she left at ten o'clock there were three names on 
HARMON was still 
at the bottom. 
BELTIK was still 
at the top. 
In her room that night she could not get to sleep 
because 
of the way the games kept playing 
themselves 
over and 
over in her head long after 
she had stopped 
enjoying 
them . 
After several 
hours o f this she got out o f bed and in her 
blue pajamas walked over to the 
dormer windows. 
She 
raised 
a shade and looked out at the newly bare trees by 
the light 
of the street 
lamp, and at the dark 
houses 
beyond 
the trees. The street 
was silent 
and empty. There was a 
sliver 
of a moon, partly 
obscured 
by clouds. The air was 
chilly. 
Beth had learned not to believe in God during 
her time 
in Methuen' s chapel, and she never prayed. But now 
she 
said, under her 

breath, Please God let me play Beltik and 
checkmate 
him. 

In her desk drawer, 
in the toothbrush 
holder, 
were 
seventeen 
green pills, 
and there were more in 
a little box 

1 00 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

on her closet 
shelf. 
She had thought 
earlier 
about taking 
two of them to help her doze off. But she did not
. She 
went back to bed, exhausted 
now and her mind blank, and 
slept soundly. 

On Saturday 
morning she 
had hoped to be playing someÂ­
one with a rating 
over 1 800. The man at registration 
had 
said there were three who were that high. But on the 
pairings 
she was shown playing 
Black against someone 
named Townes with a rating 
of 1 724. That was lower than 
her last game, the evening 
before. She went to the desk 
and asked about 
it. 
"That's 
the breaks, Harmon, " the man in the white 
shirt said. "Consider 
yourself 
lucky." 
"I want 
to play the best , " Beth said. 
"You have to get a rating 
before that happens , " the 
young man 
said. 
"How do I get a rating?" 
"You play thirty 
games in USCF tournaments 
and then 
wait four 
months. That's how you get 
a rating. " 
"That's too long. " 
The man leaned toward her. " How old are you, 
Harmon? ' ' 
"Thirteen
. " 
" You're the youngest 
person 
in the room. You can wait 
for a rating. ' ' 
Beth was furious. " I want to play Beltik. " 
The other man at the table spoke up. "If you win your 
next three games, honey. And if Beltik 
does the same ." 
"I'll win them, " Beth said. 
"No, you won't, Harmon, " the 
first young man said. 

1 0 1 

WALTER TEVIS 

" You'll have to play Sizemore and Goldmann 
first, and 
you can' t beat both of them. " 
" Sizemore and Goldmann 
shit, " the other man said. 
"The guy you're playing now is underrated. He plays 
first 
board for the university 
team and last month he came in 
fifth in Las Vegas. Don't let the rating 
fool you . " 
" What's in Las Vegas?" Beth asked. 
"The U . S . Open. " 

Beth went 
to Board Four. The man seated 
behind the white 
pieces 
was smiling 
as she came up. It was the tall, handÂ­
some one. Beth felt a bit rattled 
to see him. He looked like 
some kind of movie star. 
"Hi, Hannon, " he said
, holding 
out his hand. 
" It looks 
like we' ve been stalking 
each other. " 
She shook his big hand awkwardly 
and seated 
berself. 
There was a pause for 
a long minute before he said, "Do 
you want 
to start my clock?'' 
" Sorry , " she said. She reached 
out to start it, almost 
knocked 
it over but caught it in time. ' 'Sorry,' ' she said 
again, 
almost inaudibly. She pressed 
the button and his 
clock started 
ticking
. She looked down at the board, her 
cheeks burning. 
He played 
pawn to king four, and she replied 
with the 
Sicilian
. He continued 
with book moves and 
she followed 
with the 
Dragon variatio
n . They traded 
pawns in the cenÂ­
ter. Gradually 
she got her composure 
back, playing 
these 
mechanical 
moves, and she looked across 
the board at 
him. He was attentive 
to the pieces, 
scowling
. But even 
with a scowl on his face and his hair slightly 
mussed he 
was handsome. 
Something 
in Beth's stomach 
felt strange 

1 02 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

as she looked at him, with 
his broad shoulders 
and clear 
complexion and 
his brow wrinkled 
in concentration. 
He surprised 
her by bringing 
his queen 
out. It was a 
bold move, and she studied it 
for a while and saw that 
there wasn't any weakness 
to it. She brought 
out her own 
queen. He moved a knight to the 
fifth rank, and Beth 
moved a knight to the fifth rank . He checked 
with a 
bishop, and she defended 
with a 
pawn. He retreated 
the 
bishop. She was feeling light now, and her fingers 
with the 
pieces 
were nimble. Both 
players began moving fast but 
easily. She gave a non-threatening 
check to his king, and 
he pulled 
away delicately and began advancing 
pawns. She 
stopped 
that handily with 
a pin and then feinted on the 
queenside 
with a rook. He was undeceived 
by the feint 
and, smiling, 
removed her pin, and on his next move 
continued 
the pawn advances. She retreat
ed, hiding her 
Â·king in a queenside 
castle. 
She felt somehow spacious 
and 
amused, 
yet her face remained 
serious. They continued 
their dance. 
It made her sad in 
a way when she eventually 
saw how 
to beat him. It was after the nineteenth 
move, and she felt 
herself 
resisting 
it as it 
opened up 
in her mind, hating to let 
go of the pleasant ballet they 
had danced together. 
But 
there it was: four moves and 
he would have to lose a rook 
or worse. She hesitated and made the 
first move of the 
sequence. 
He didn't see what 
was happening 
until two moves 
later, 
when he frowned suddenly 
and said, "Jesus Christ, 
Harmon, I'm going to drop a rook! " She loved his voice; 
she loved the way he said it. 
He shook his head in mock 
bafflement; 
she loved that. 
Some players who had finished their game 
early had 

1 03 

WALTER TEVIS 

gathered 
around the board, and a couple were 
whispering 
about the maneuver 
Beth had brought 
off. 
Townes went on playing 
for five more moves, and Beth 
felt genuinely 
sorry for him when he resigned, 
tipping 
his 
king over and saying 
"Damn! " But he stood up
, stretched 
and smiled down at her. " You' re one hell of a chess 
player, 
Harmon, " he said. "How old are you?" 
' 'Thirteen
. ' ' 
He whistled. 
" Where do you go to school?" 
' 'Fairfield 
Junior.
' ' 
" Yeah , " he said. " I know where that is. " 
He was even better-looking 
than a movie star. 
An hour 
later she drew 
Goldmann 
and Board Three. She 
walked into the tournament 
room at 
exactly 
eleven, and 
the people standing 
stopped 
talking 
when she came in. 
Everyone 
looked at her. She heard someone 
whisper, 
"ThirÂ­
teen fucking years old , ' ' and immediately 
the thought 
came into her mind, along with the exultant 
feeling the 
whispered 

voice had given her: I could have done this at 
eight. 

Goldmann 
was tough 
and silent 
and slow. He was a 
short, 
heavy man, and he played the black pieces 
like a 
gruff general trained in 
defense. For the first hour everyÂ­
thing that Beth tried he got out of. Every 
piece he had was 
protected; 
it seemed as though there were double the usual 
complement 
of pawns 
to protect 
them. 
Beth got fidgety 
during 
the long waits for him to move; 
once after she had advanced 
a bishop 
she got up, and went 
to the bathroom. Something 
was hurting in 
her abdomen, 
and she felt a bit faint. She washed her face with 
cold 
water and dried it on a paper towel. As she was leaving, 
the girl she'd played her 
first game with came in. 
Packer. 

1 04 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

Packer looked glad to see her. "You ' re moving right on 
up, aren' t you?" she said. 
" So far," Beth said, feeling another 
twinge in her 
belly. 
"I heard you're playing 
Goldmann. " 
" Yes, " Beth said. " I have to get back. " 
" Sure , " Packer said, " sure. Beat his ass , will you? Just 
beat his 
ass . ' ' 
Suddenly 
Beth grinned. " Okay , " she said
. 
When she got back she saw that Goldmann 
had moved, 
and her clock was ticking. 
He sat there in his dark suit 
looking 
bored . She felt refreshed and ready. She seated 
herself 
and put everything 
out of her mind except the 
sixty-four 
squares in front of her. After 
a minute she saw 
that if she attacked 
on both flanks simultane
ously, as 
Morphy did sometimes, Goldmann 
would have difficulty 
playing 
it safe. She played pawn to queen rook four. 
It worked . 
After five moves she had 
opened his king up 
a little
, and after three more she was at 
his throat. She paid 
no attention 
to Goldmann 
himself 
or to the crowd or to the 
feeling in 
her lower abdomen or the sweat that had broken 
out on her brow. She played against 
the board only, with 
lines of force etched for 
her into its surface: the small 
stubborn 
fields 
for the pa
wns, the enormous 
one for the 
queen, the gradations 
in between. Just before his clock 
was about 
to run out she checkmated 
him. 
When she circled 
her name on the score sheet she 
looked again at the number of Goldmann's rati
ng. It was 
1 997. People were applauding. 
She went directly 
to the girls' room and discovered that 
she had begun 
to menstruate
. For a moment 
she felt, 
looking 
at the redness 
in the water below her, as though 

1 05 

WALTER TEVIS 

something 
catastrophic 
had happened. Had she bled on the 
chair at Board Three? Were the people 
there staring 
at the 
stains 
of her blood? But she saw with relief that 
her cotton 
panties 
were barely spotted. She thought abruptly 
of JoÂ­
lene. If it hadn' t been for Jolene, 
she would have had no 
idea what was happening. No one else had said a word 
about this-cer
tainly not 
Mrs. Wheatley . She felt a sudden 
warmth for Jolene, 
remembering 
that Jolene 
had also told 
her what to do ' 'in an emergency
. ' ' Beth began pulling 
a 
long sheet from the roll of toilet 
paper and folding it into a 
tightly 
packed rectangle. The pain in her abdomen had 
eased. She was 
menstruati
ng, and she had 
just beaten 
Goldmann: 
1 997. She put 
the folded paper into her pantÂ­
ies, pulled 
them up tight, 
straightened 
her skirt and walked 
confidently 
back into the playing 
area. 

Beth had seen Sizemore before; 
he was a small, ugly, 
thin-faced man who smoked cigarettes 
continuously. 
SomeÂ­
one had told her he was State Champion before 
Beltik. 
Beth would play him 
on Board Two in the room with the 
sign reading 
"Top Boards. " 
Sizemore wasn't there yet, but next to her, at Board 
One, Beltik was facing in her direction. Beth looked at 
him and then 
looked away. It was a few minutes 
before 
three. The lights 
in this smaller 
room-bare 
bulbs under a 
metal protection 
basket-seemed 
brighter 
than those in the 
big room, brighter 
than they had been in the morning, 
and 
for a moment the shine on the varnished 
floor with its 
painted 
red lines was blinding. 
Sizemore came in, combing 
his hair in a nervous, quick 
way. A cigarette 
hung from his thin lips. 
As he pulled 
his 
chair back, 
Beth felt herself becoming very tight. 

1 06 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

"Ready?" Sizemore asked gruffly, slipping 
the comb 
into his shirt pocket. 
" Yes , " she said and punched 
his clock. 
He played pawn 
to king four and then pulled 
out his 
comb and 
started 
biting 
on it the way 
a person 
bites on the 
eraser 
end of a pencil. Beth played pawn to queen bishop 
four. 
By the middle game Sizemore had begun 
combing 
his 
hair after each move. 
He hardly 
ever looked at Beth but 
concentrated on the board, wriggling 
in his seat sometimes 
as he combed and parted 
and reparted 
his hair. The game 
was even, and there were no weaknesses 
on either 
side. 
There was nothing 
to do but find the best squares for her 
knights 
and bishops 
and wait. She would move, write the 
move down on her score sheet and sit back in her chair. 
After a while a crowd began to 
gather 
at the ropes. 
She 
glanced 
at them from time to 
time. There were more 
people watching 
her play than watching 
Beltik. She kept 
looking 
at the board, waiting 
for something 
to open up. 
Once when 
she looked up she saw Annette 
Packer standing 
at the back. Packer smiled 
and Beth nodded to her. 
Back at the board, Sizemore brought 
a knight 
to queen 
five, posting 
it in 
the best place for a knight. 
Beth frowned; 
she couldn't dislodge 
it. The pieces were thick 
in the 
middle of the board and 
for a moment she lost the sense of 
them. There were occasional 
twinges 
in her 
abdomen. She 
could feel the thick batch of paper between 
her thighs. She 
adjusted 
herself 
in her 
chair and squinted 
at the board. 
This wasn't good . Sizemore was creeping 
up on her.' She 
looked at his face. He had put away his comb and was 
looking 
at the pieces 
in front of 
him with satisfaction. Beth 
leaned 
over the table, digging 
her fists into her cheeks, and 

1 07 

WALTER TEVIS 

tried to penetrate 
the position
. Some people in the crowd 
were whispering. With an effort she drove distractions 
from her mind. It was time to fight back. If she moved the 
knight 
on the left . . . No. If she opened the long diagonal 
for her white bishop . . . 
That was it. She pushed the 
pawn up, and the bishop's power was tripled. The picture 
started to become 
clearer. 
She leaned 
back in her seat 
and 
took a 
deep breath. 
During the next five moves Sizemore kept bringing 
pieces 
up, but Beth, seeing 
the limits 
to what he could do 
to her, kept her attention 
focused on the far right-hand 
corner of the board, on Sizemore's queenside; 
when the 
time came she 
brought 
her bishop down in the middle of 
his clustered pieces there, setting 
it on his knight two 
square. From 
where it sat now, two of his pieces 
could 
capture 
it, but if either 
did, he would be in trouble. 
She looked 
at him. He had taken out his comb again and 
was running 
it through 
his hair. His clock 
was ticking
. 
It took him fifteen minutes 
to make the move, and when 
he did it 
was a shock. 
He took the bishop ï¿½ith his rook. 
Didn't he know he was a fool to move the rook off the 
back rank? Couldn't he see that? 
She looked back at the 
board, double-checked 
the position 
and brought 
out her 
queen. 
He didn' t see it until 
the move after next, and his game 
fell apart. He still 
had his comb in his hand six moves later 
when she got her 
queen's pawn, passed, 
to the sixth rank. 
He brought 
his rook under the pawn. She attacked 
it with 
her bishop. 
Sizemore stood up, put his 
comb in his 
pocket, 
reached 
down to the board and set his king on its side. 
" You win , " he said grimly. The 
applause 
was thunderous . 
After she had turned i n the score sheet she waited while 

1 08 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

the young man checked 
it, made a mark on a list in front 
of him, stood up and walked to the bulletin 
board. He took 
the pushpins 
from the card saying SIZEMORE 
and threw the 
card into a green metal 
wastebasket
. Then he pulled 
the 
pins out of the bottom card and raised 
it to 
where Sizemore's 
had been. THE UNDEFEATED 
list now read: BELTIK, HARMON. 
When she was walking 
toward the girls' room Beltik 
came out of 
"Top Boards" 
striding 
fast and looking 
very 
pleased 
with himself. 
He was carrying 
the little 
score 
sheet, 
on his way to the winners' basket. 
He didn't seem 
to see Beth. 
She went over to 
the doorway of the "Top Boards" 
room, and Townes was standing 
there. There were lines of 
fatigue in his face; he looked like Rock Hudson, except 
for 
the weariness. "Good work, Harmon, " he said
. 
" I ' m sorry you lost , " she said. 
" Yeah , " he said. "It's back to the drawing 
board. " 
And then, nodding 
to where Beltik 
was standing at 
the 
front table with a small crowd gathered near him, 
he said, 
"He's a killer, 
Harmon. A genuine 
killer.
" 
She looked at his 
face. " You need a rest. " 
He smiled 
down at her. "What I need, Harmon, is some 
of your 
talent. 
" 
As she passed the front table, Beltik 
took a step toward 
her and said, "Tomorrow. " 

When Beth came into the living 
room just before supper, 
Mrs . Wheatley 
looked pale and strange. She was sitting in 
the chintz 
armchair 
and her face was puffy. She was 
holding 
a brightly 
colored postcard in her lap . 
"I've started 
menstruati
ng, " Beth said. 

1 09 

WALTER TEVIS 

Mrs . Wheatley 
blinked. "That's nice , " she said, as 
though from a great distance. 
"I'll need some pads or 
something, " Beth said. 
Mrs . Wheatley 
seemed nonplused 
for a moment. 
Then 
she brightened. "That's certainly 
a milepost 
for you. Why 
don't you just go up to my room and look in the top 
drawer of my chiffonier? Take all you require." 
' 'Thank you , ' ' Beth said, heading 
for the stairs. 
" And, dear," Mrs. Wheatley 
said, "bring down that 
little 
bottle 
of green pills 
by my bedside. " 
When Beth came back she gave the pills to Mrs. 
Wheatley. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
had half 
a glass of beer sitting 
beside her; she 
took out two of the pills and swallowed 
them with the beer. " My tranquillity 
needs to be refurÂ­
bished, " she said. 
"Is something 
wrong?" Beth asked. 
' 'I'm not Aristot
le, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said, "but it could 
be construed 
as wrong. I have received 
a message 
from 
Mr. Wheatley
. " 
' 'What did he say?'' 
" Mr. Wheatley 
has been indefin
itely detained 
in the 
Southwes
t. The American 
Southwest
. ' ' 
" Oh , " Beth said. 
" Between Denver and Butte . " 
Beth sat down on the sofa. 
"Aristotle 
was a moral philosopher
, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said, "while I am a housewif
e. Or was a housewif
e . " 
"Can't they send me back if you 
don't have a husband?" 
" You put it concretel
y . " Mrs. Wheatley 
sipped her 
beer. "They won't if we lie about it. " 
"That's easy enough, " Beth said. 
"You ' re a good soul, Beth , " Mrs. Wheatley 
said, fin-

1 10 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

ishing her beer. "Why don't you heat the two chicken 
dinners in the freezer? Set the oven at four hundred.'' 
Beth had been holding two sanitary 
napkins in her right 
hand. "I don't know how to put these on." 
Mrs. Wheatley straightened 
herself up from her slumped 
position in the chair. "I am no longer a wife," sbe said, 
"except by legal fiction. 
I believe I can learn to be a 
mother. I'll show you how if you promise me never to go 
near Denver.'' 

During the night Beth woke to hear rain on the roof over 
her head and intermittent 
rattling 
against the panes of her 
dormer windows. She had been dreaming of water, of 
herself swimming 
easily in a quiet ocean of still water. She 
put a pillow over her head and curled up on ber side, 
trying to get back to sleep. But she could not. The rain 
was loud, and as it continued 
to fall, the sad languor of her 
dream was replaced by the image of a chessboard 
filled 
with pieces demanding her attention, demanding 
the clarity 
of her intelligence. 
It was two in the morning and she did not get back to 
sleep for the rest of the night. It was still raining when she 
went downstairs 
at seven; the backyard 
outside the kitchen 
window looked like a swamp with hillocks of near-dead 
grass sticking up like islands. 
She was not certain how to 
fry eggs but decided she could boil some. She got two 
from the refrigerator, 
filled a pan with water and put it on 
the burner. She would play pawn to king four against him, 
and hope for the Sicilian. 
She boiled the eggs five minutes 
and put them in cold water. She could see Beltik's face, 
youthful, arrogant and smart. His eyes were small and 

lll 

WALTER TEVIS 

had a copy of Modern Chess Openings, 

black. 
When he stepped 
toward her yesterday as she was 
leaving, 
some part of her had 
thought 
he would hit her. 
The eggs were perfect; she opened them with a knife, 
put them in a cup and ate them with salt and butter. 
Her 
eyes were grainy under the lids. The final game 
would 
begin at eleven; 
it was seven-twenty 
now. She wished she 
to look over 
variations 
on the Sicilian
. Some of 
the other players 
at the 
tournament 
had carried 
battered 
copies 
of the book under 
their arms. 
It was only drizzling 
when she left the house at ten, and 
Mrs . Wheatley 
was still 
upstairs 
asleep. Before she left, 
Beth went into the 
bathroom 
and checked 
the sanitary belt 
Mrs . Wheatley 
had given her to 
wear, and the thick white 
pad. It was all right. She put 
on her 
galoshes 
and her blue 
coat, got Mrs. Wheatley
' s umbrella from the closet and 
left. 

She had noticed before that 
the pieces 
at Board One were 
different. They were solid wooden ones 
like Mr. Ganz' s 
and not the hollow plastic 
pieces that sat o n the other 
boards 
at the tournament. 
When she walked by the table in 
the empty room 
at ten-thirty 
she reached 
out and picked up 
the white 
king. It was satisfyingly 
heavy, with a solid 
lead weight 
and green felt on the bottom. 
She placed the 
piece on its home 
square, stepped 
back over the velvet 
rope and walked to the girls' 
room. She washed her face 
for the third time that day, tightened 
her sanitary belt, 
combed her bangs 
and went back 
to the gymnasium. More 
players had 
come in. She stuffed her hands into the pockÂ­
ets of her 
skirt so that no one could see 
they were 
trembling. 
When eleven 
o'clock came she was ready behind the 

1 12 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

white pieces 
at Board One. Boards Two and Three had 
already 
started 
their games. Sizemore was at Board Two. 
She didn' t recognize 
the others. 
Ten minutes 
passed, 
and Beltik 
did not 
appear. 
The 
tournament 
director 
in the white shirt 
climbed over and 
stood near Beth for a 
minute. "Hasn't shown yet?" he 
said softly. 
Beth shook her head. 
"Make your move 
and punch the clock, " the 
director 
whispered. " You should 
have done it at eleven. " 
That annoyed 
her. No one had told her about that. She 
moved pawn to 
king four and started 
Beltik' s clock. 
It was ten more minutes 
before Beltik came 
in. Beth's 
stomach 
hurt and her 
eyes smarted. Beltik 
looked casual 
and relaxed, wearing 
a bright-red 
shirt and tan corduroy 
pants. " Sorry , " he said in a normal voice. 
" Extra cup of 
coffee. " The other players 
looked over at him with irritaÂ­
tion. Beth said nothing. 
Beltik, still 
standing, loosened 
an extra button on his 
shirt front and held out his hand. "Harry Beltik , " he said. 
"What's your name?" 
He must know 
what her name was. "I'm Beth HarÂ­
mon , " she said, taking 
his hand but avoiding his 
eyes. 
He seated 
himself 
behind the black pieces, 
rubbed his 
hands together 
briskly 
and moved his king pawn to the 
third square. 
He punched 
Beth's clock smartly. 
The French Defense. She had never played it. She 
didn' t like the 
look of it. The thing 
to do was play pawn to 
queen four. But what happened 
if he played the 
same? Did 
she trade pawns or push one of them forward, or bring out 
her knight? She 
squinted 
and shook her head; it was 
difficult to picture what the board would 
look like after the 

1 13 

WALTER TEVIS 

moves. She looked 
again, rubbed her eyes, and played 
pawn to queen four. When she reached 
out to punch the 
clock she hesitat
ed. Had she made a mistake? 
But it was 
too late now . She pressed 
the button hastily and 
as it 
clicked down Beltik immediately 
picked up his queen 
pawn, put it on queen four and slapped down the 
button 
on 
his clock. 
Although 
it was difficult 
to see with her 
usual clarity, 
she had 
not lost her sense of the 
requirements 
of an 
opening. 
She brought 
out her knights 
and involved herself 
for a while in 
a struggle 
for the center 
squares. But Beltik, 
moving fast, nipped off one of her pawns and she saw that 
she couldn't capture 
the pawn he did it with. She tried to 
shrug off the advantage 
she'd allowed 
and went 
on playing. 
She got her pieces 
off the back 
rank, and castled. 
She 
looked over the board at Beltik. 
He seemed completely 
at 
ease; he was looking 
at the game going on next to them. 
Beth felt a knot in her 
stomach; 
she could not get comfortÂ­
able in her seat. The heavy cluster of pieces 
and pawns in 
the center 
of the board seemed for a while to have no 
pattern
, to make no 
sense. 
Her clock was ticking. She inclined 
her head to look at 
its fac
e; twenty-five 
minutes 
were gone, and she was 
still 
down by a pawn. And Beltik 
had used only twenty-two 
minutes altogether, 
even including 
the time he'd wasted by 
being late. There was a ringing 
in her ears, and the bright 
light in the room hurt her eyes. Beltik 
was leaning 
back 
with his arms outstretc
hed, yawning, 
showing 
the black 
places on 
the undersides 
of his teeth . 
She found what looked like a good square for her 
knight, 
reached 
out her hand and then stopped
. The move would 
be terrible; something 
had to be done about 
his queen 

1 14 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

before he had it on the rook file 
and was 
ready to 
threaten
. 
She had to protect 
and attack 
at the same time, and she 
couldn't 
see how. The pieces 
in front of her just sat there. 
She should 
have taken a green pill last night, 
to make her 
sleep. 
Then she saw a move that looked 
sensible 
and quickly 
made it. She brought 
a knight back near the 
king, protectÂ­
ing herself 
against 
Beltik' s queen. 
He raised 
his eyebrows 
almost 
imperceptibly and 
immeÂ­
diately 
took a pawn on the other 
side of the board. There 
was suddenly 
a diagonal 
open for his 
bishop. The bishop 
was aimed 
at the knight 
she' d wasted time bringing 
back, 
and she was down by another 
pawn. At the corner 
of 
Beltik's mouth was a sly little 
smile. She quickly 
looked 
away from his face, frightened. 
She had to do something. He would be all over 
her king 
in four or five moves. She needed to concentrate, to see it 
clearly. But when she looked 
at the 
board, everything 
was 
dense, interlocked
, complicated , dangerous. Then she 
thought 
of something 
to do. With her clock still 
running 
she stood up, stepped 
over the rope 
and walked through 
the small crowd of silent 
spectators 
to the 
main gym floor 
and across 
it to the girls' room. There was no one there. 
She went to a sink, washed 
her face with 
cold water, 
wet a 
handful 
of paper towels 
and held them for a minute 
to the 
back of her neck. After she 
threw them away she 
went into 
one of the little stalls 
and, sitting, checked 
her sanitary 
napkin. It was okay. She sat there 
relaxing, 
letting 
her 
mind go blank. 
Her elbows were on her knees, her head 
was bent down. 
With an effort 
of will she made the chessboard with the 
game on Board One on it appear in front of her. There it 

1 15 

WALTER TEVIS 

was. She could 
see immediately 
that it was difficult, 
but 
not as difficult as some of the games 
she'd memorized 
from the book at Morris' Book Store. 
The pieces 
before 
her, in her imaginat
ion, were crisp and sharply 
focused. 
She stayed where she was, not worrying 
about time, 
until she had it penetrated 
and understood. 
Then she got 
up, washed her face again and walked back into 
the gym . 
She had found her move. 
There were more people gathered 
in ' 'Top Boards' ' than 
before; as games ended they came 
in to watch the finals. 
She pushed by them, stepped 
over the rope and sat down. 
Her hands were perfectly steady, and her stomach 
and eyes 
felt fine. She reached 
out and moved; she punched 
the 
clock firmly . 
Beltik 
studied 
the move for a few minutes 
and took her 
knight 
with his bishop, 
as she knew he would. She did not 
retake; 
she brought 
a bishop over to attack 
one of his 
rooks. He movd the 
rook out of the line of fire. He had to. 
She felt the blood rush into her cheeks as 
she brought 
her 
queen from the back to the center 
of the board. It now 
threatened 
to take the rook, pinned the king's knight 
pawn 
and could take the 
bishop with a check. She looked at 
Beltik. He was studying 
the board and rolling 
up his 
sleeves
. His clock was ticking
. 
It took him almost 
fifteen 
minutes 
to find the rook move 
that Beth, in the bathroom, had been certain 
he would 
make. She was ready . Her rook came over behind her 
queen and 
she heard Beltik 
take in his breath sharply . 
Someone 
i n the crowd began to whisper. 
Beth waited. 
After ten more minutes 
Beltik 
moved his queen into a 
defensive 
position
. It wouldn't work. She 
reached 
out with 

1 16 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

her hand 
steady 
and her 
mind crystalline 
and advanced 
a 
pawn, attacking his 
queen. 
Beltik 
stared 
at the pawn 
for a moment 
as though it were 
a cockroach 
on the board. If he took it, 
he would find his 
queen pinned, unable to move. If he moved his queen 
away, Beth would 
begin a series 
of threats . If he 
left it 
where it was, he would lose it. " Son of a bitch! " he 
whispered. 
By the time he had decided 
what to do, there were only 
ten more minutes 
on his 
clock. Beth had 
fifty. He had 
wasted his time stretching 
his arms and 
wriggling 
in his 
chair and distorting 
his face and, every now and then, 
starting 
out as if 
he knew what to do and then stopping, 
his 
hand arrested 
in midair 
over a piece. Finally 
he picked up 
the queen and moved 
it across 
the board, out of harm' s 
way. 
She brought 
up a bishop behind her queen: the threat 
was checkmate, and he was forced to parry it with his 
queen. She ignored 
the queen when he brought 
it over and 
pushed her rook to the third rank, where it was free to 
move either 
right or left. She would get either 
his queen or 
a checkmate
, whatever 
he did. 
Beltik 
was bent over the board with his face on his open 
palms. She could hear his foot tapping. "Son of a bitch, " 
he said. "Son of a bitch. " 
Beth spoke softly. " I think that's it. " 
" I can get out of this. " 
" I don't think so, " Beth said. 
He had four more 
minutes 
on his 
clock. He kept staring 
at the board as though he were going to destroy 
it with the 
intensity 
of his 
desire to find some way out of the trap. 
Finally, with thirty 
seconds 
left, he grabbed his queen and 

1 17 

WALTER TEVIS 

slammed 
it in front of the rook, interposing 
and offering to 
sacrifice the queen for the rook. He slapped 
the button 
down on his 
clock, leaned back in his 
chair and drew a 
deep breath. 
" It doesn't work," Beth said. "I don't have to 
take the 
queen . ' ' 
" Move , " Beltik 
said. 
' 'I 'll check you first 
with the bishop-" 

' 'Move!' ' 

She nodded and checked 
with the bishop. Beltik, 
with 
his clock 
ticking, quickly 
moved his king away and pressed 
the button . Then Beth did 
what she 
had planned 
all along. 
She brought 
her queen crashing 
down next to 
the king, 
sacrificing 
it. Beltik 
looked at her, stunned. She stared 
back at him. He shrugged, 
snatched 
up the queen and 
stopped 
his clock by hitting 
it with 
the base of the captured 
piece. 
Beth pushed her other bishop 
from the back rank out to 
the middle of the board and said, "Check. Mate next 
move." Beltik 
stared 
at it 
for a moment, 
said, "Son of a 
bitch! " and stood up. 
"The rook mates, " Beth said. 
" Son of a bitch, " Beltik 
said. 
The crowd that had now filled the room began 
applauding. 
Beltik, still scowling, held out his hand, and Beth 
shook it.

CHAPTER 5 

They were 
ready to close by the 
time she got to the teller. 
She'd had to 
wait for the bus after school 
and wait 
again 
transfer
ring down Main. And this was the second 
bank. 
She'd carried 
the folded check in her blouse 
pocket all 
day, under the 
sweater. 
It was in her 
hand when the man 
in front of her picked up his rolls 
of nickels 
and stuffed 
them in the pocket of his overcoat 
and left the space at the 
window for her. She set her 
hand on the cold marble, 
holding 
the check out and 
standing 
on tiptoe, to be able to 
see the face 
of the teller. 
"I'd like to 
open an account, " 
Beth said. 
The man glanced at the check. "How old are you, 
miss?'' 
' 'Thirteen. ' ' 
' 'I'm sorry, " he said. " You' II need a parent 
or guardian 
with you . "

Beth put the check back in her blouse 
pocket and left. 
At the house, Mrs. Wheatley 
had four empty Pabst Blue 
Ribbon beer bottles sitting 
on the little 
table by her 
chair. 
The TV was off. Beth had picked up the afternoon paper 
from the front porch; 
she unfolded it as she 
came into the 
living 
room. 
"How was school, dear?" Mrs. Wheatley
' s voice was 
dim and far away. 
" It was okay." As Beth set 
the newspaper 
on the green 
plastic hassock 
by the sofa she saw with quiet 
astonishÂ­
ment that her own picture 
was printed 
on the front page, at 
the bottom. Near 
the top 
was the face of Nikita 
Khrushchev 
and at the bottom, one column wide, was her face, scowlÂ­
ing beneath 
a headline: 
LOCAL PRODIGY TAKES CHESS 
ToURNEY. 
Under this, in smaller 
letters, boldface: TWELVEÂ­
YEAR-OLD 
ASTONISHES 
EXPERTS. She remembered 
the man 
taking 
her picture before they gave her the trophy and the 
check. 
She had told him 
she was thirteen. 
Beth bent over, reading the paper: 

The world of Kentucky Chess 
was astonished 
this 
weekend by the playing 
of a local girl, who triÂ­
umphed over hardened 
players to win the Kentucky 
State Championshi
p. Elizabeth Harmon, a seventhÂ­
grade student 
at Fairfield 
Junior, 
showed "a 
mastery 
of the game unequaled 
by any female' ' according 
to 
Harry Beltik, whom Miss Harmon defeated 
for the 
state crown. 

Beth grimaced; 
she hated the picture 
of herself. 
It showed 
her freckles 
and her small 
nose all too clearly. 
" I want to open a bank account, " she said
.

with?' ' 

' 'A bank account?'' 
" You'll have to go with me. " 
" But, my dear , " Mrs . Wheatley 
said, "what would you 
open a bank account 
Beth reached 
into her blouse 
pocket, 
took out the check 
and handed it to her. Mrs. Wheatley 
sat up in 
her chair and 
held the check in her hand as though it were a Dead Sea 
Scroll . She was silent 
for a moment, 
reading 
it. Then she 
said softly, "One hundred dollars . " 
" I need a parent 
or guardian. 
At the bank. " 
"One hundred 
dollars, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said. "Then 
you won it? ' ' 
" Yes. It says 'First Place' 
on the 
check. " 
" I see, " Mrs . Wheatley 
said. " I hadn't the foggiest 
idea people 
made money 
playing chess. " 
"Some tournaments 
have bigger 
prizes 
than that . " 
"Goodness! " Mrs. Wheatley 
was still 
staring at the 
check. 
"We can go to the bank after school 
tomorrow. " 
"Certainly , " Mrs. Wheatley 
said. 
The next day, when they came into 
the living 
room after 
the bank, there was a copy of 
bler's 
bench in front of the sofa. Mrs. Wheatley 
hung her 
coat in the hall closet 
and picked 
up the magazine
. " While 
you were at 
school, " she said, "I was leafing 
through 
this. I see there's a major tournament 
in Cincinna
ti the 
second week in December. 
First prize 
is five hundred 
dollars. ' ' 
Beth studied 
her for a long moment. 
" I have to be in 
school 
then, " she said. "And Cincinna
ti's pretty far 
from 
here.' ' 
' ' The Greyhound 
bus requires 
only two hours for the 
trip, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said. "I took the liberty of calling
. "

to the Ladies' 
Home Journal. " 

" What about school?" 
Beth said. 
" I can write a medical 
excuse, 
claiming 
mono . " 
" Mono?" 
" Mononucleos
is. It's quite the thing 
in your age 
group, 
according 
Beth kept looking 
at her, trying 
not to 
let the astonishÂ­
ment show in her face. Mrs . Wheatley
's dishonesty 
seemed 
in every way to match her own. Then she said, " Where 
would we stay?' ' 
' 'At the Gibson Hotel, in a double room at twenty-two 
dollars a night. 
The GreyhoundÂ· tickets 
will be elevenÂ­
eighty 
apiece, and there will, of course, be the cost of 
food. I have calculated all of it. Even if you win second or 
third prize, 
there will be a profit. ' ' 
Beth had twenty dollars in cash and a packet of ten 
checks in her plastic 
purse. 
" I need to buy some chess 
books, " she said. 
" By all means, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said, smiling
. "And if 
you'll make out a check for 
twenty-three dollars and sixty 
cents, 
I'll get the 
bus tickets 
tomorrow. " 

After buying Modern Chess Openings and a book on the 
endgame at Morris', Beth walked across the street 
to 
Purcell ' s 
Department 
Store. She knew from the way 
girls 
talked 
at school that Purcell ' s was better 
than Ben SnyÂ­
der's . She found what she 
wanted on the fourth floor: 
a 
wooden set almost 
identical 
to the one Mr. Ganz owned, 
with hand-carved 
knights 
and big, substantial 
pawns, and 
rooks that were fat and solid. She was undecided 
for a 
while over the board and almost bought a wooden 
one 
before settling 
on a folding 
linen board with green and 
beige squares. It would be more portable 
than the other. 

1 22 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

Back home she cleared off her desk, put the board on it 
and set up the 
pieces. She piled her new 
chessbooks 
on 
one side and placed 
the tall silver 
trophy in the shape of a 
chess king 
on the other. She 
turned on her student 
lamp 
and sat at the 
desk, just looking 
at the pieces, at the way 
their curves 
picked up the light. She sat for what seemed 
like a long time, her mind quiet. Then she picked up 
Modern Chess Openings. This time she began at the 
beginning. 

She had never seen anything 
like the Gibson Hotel 
before. 
Its size 
and bustle, 
the bright 
chandeliers 
in its lobby, 
the 
heavy red carpeting, the flowers, 
even the three revolving 
doors and the 
uniformed 
doorman 
who stood beside 
them 
were overwhelming. 
She and Mrs. Wheatley walked 
up to 
the front of the hotel from 
the bus stat
ion, carrying 
their 
new luggage . Mrs . 
Wheatley 
refused to hand it 
over to the 
doorman. She lugged 
her suitcase up to the front desk and 
registered 
for them 
both, unperturbed 
by the look the 
room 
clerk gave them
. 
In the room afterward, Beth 
began to relax. There were 
two big windows 
overlooking 
Fourth Street 
with its rush 
hour traffic. It was a crisp, 
cold day outside
. Inside 
they 
had this thick-c
arpeted 
room with the big white bathroom 
and fluffy red towels and a huge plate-glass 
mirror coverÂ­
ing one wall. There was a color TV on the dresser 
and a 
bright-red bedspread 
on each 
of the beds
. 
Mrs . Wheatley 
was inspecting 
the room, checking 
the 
dresser 
drawers, clicking 
the TV on and off, patting 
away 
a wrinkle 
on the bedspread
. " Well," she said, "I asked 
them for a pleasant 
room, and I believe 
they gave it to 
me. " She seated 
herself 
in the high-backed 
Victorian chair 

1 23 

WALTER TEVIS 

ti Enquirer 

by her bed as though she had lived in the Gibson Hotel all 
her life. 
The tournament 
was on the mezzanine 
in the Taft Room; 
all Beth had to do was take the 
elevator. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
found them a diner down the street where they 
had bacon 
and eggs for 
breakfast, then she went back to bed with a 
copy of the Cincinna
and a pack of ChesterÂ­
fields while Beth went down to the tournament 
and regisÂ­
tered. She still 
did not 
have a rating, but this time one of 
the men at the desk knew who she was; they didn' t try to 
put her in the Beginners 
Section. 
There would be two 
games a day, and the 
time control 
would be 1 20/40, which 
meant you had two 
hours to make forty moves. 
While she was signing 
in, she could hear a deep voice 
coming through 
one of the double 
doors that stood 
open to 
the Taft Room, where the games 
would be. She looked 
that way and saw 
part of the big ballroom, 
with a long row 
of empty tables 
and a few men walking 
around. 
When she walked in, she saw a strange 
man slouched on 
a sofa 
with black-booted 
feet resting 
on a coffee table. 
' ' . . . and the rook comes to the seventh 
rank , ' ' he was 
saying. 
" Bone in the throat, 
man, that rook there. He took 
one look at it and paid up.' ' He leaned his 
head against the 
back of the sofa 
and laughed loudly 
in a deep baritone. 
"Twenty 
bucks. " 
Since it was early, there were only half a dozen people 
in the room, and no one was at the long rows of tables 
with paper chessboa
rds on them. Everyone 
was listening 
to 
the man talking
. He was about twenty-f
ive and looked like 
a pirate. He wore dirty jeans, 
a black turtleneck 
and a 
black wool cap pulled 
down to his heavy eyebr
ows. He 
had a thick black mustache 
and clearly 
needed a shave; the 

1 24 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

backs of his hands were tanned and scraped-looking
. "The 
Caro-Kann 
Defense , " he said, laughing. " A genuine 
bummer.' ' 
"What's wrong with the Caro-Kann
?" someone 
asked. 
A neat young man in a camel' s hair sweater. 
' ' All pawns and no hope.' ' He lowered his legs to 
the 
floor and sat up. On the table was a soiled old 
beige-andÂ­
green chessboard with battered 
wooden pieces 
on it. The 
head had 
fallen off the black king at some time or other; 
it 
was held on with a piece of gritty 
adhesive 
tape. " I ' ll 
show you, " the man said, sliding the board over. Beth 
was now standing next to 
him. She was the only girl in the 
room. The man reached 
down to the board and with 
surprising 
delicacy 
picked 
up the white king 
pawn with his 
fingertips 
and dropped 
it lightly 
on king four. Then he 
picked up the black queen 
bishop 
pawn and dropped 
it on 
queen' s bishop three, put White's queen pawn on the 
fourth rank and did the same with Black's. He looked up 
at the 
people around him, who were by now all 
paying 
close attenti
on. 
"The Caro-Kann. Right?" 
Beth was familiar 
with these moves, but she 
had never 
seen them played. 
She expected 
the man 
to move the white 
queen' s knight 
next, and he did. Then he had the black 
pawn capture 
the white, 
and took the 
capturing 
pawn with 
the white knight. 
He played 
B lack' s king knight 
to bishop 
three and brought 
White' s other knight 
out. Beth rememÂ­
bered the move. Looking 
at it 
now, it seemed tame. She 
found herself 
speaking up. 
' 'I ' d take the 
knight, " she said 
quietly
. 
The man looked 
at her and raised 
his eyebrows . ' 'Aren't 
you that kid from Kentucky-the one who wiped 
out 
Harry Beltik?'' 

1 25 

WALTER TEVIS 

" Yes , " Beth said. " If you take the knight, 
it doubles 
his pawns . . . " 
" Big deal
, " the man said: "All pawns and no hope. 
Here ' s how to win with Black." He left the knight 
in the 
center 
of the board and played Black' s pawn to king four. 
Then he continued 
laying 
out the moves of a game, shuffling 
the pieces 
around on the board with 
casual 
dexterity
, occasionÂ­
ally pointing 
out a potential 
trap. The game built to a 
balanced 
fugue in the center. 
It was like time-lapse 
photoÂ­
graphy on TV where a pale-green stalk humps itself 
from dirt, 
heightens, swells 
and explodes 
into a peony or a rose . 
Some other 
people had come into the room and were 
watching. Beth was feeling a new kind of excitement with 
this display
, with the knowingnes
s, the clarity and nerve 
of 
the man in the black cap. He began trading 
pieces 
in the 
center, 
lifting the captured 
ones off the board with his 
fingertips 
as though they were dead 
flies, keeping 
up a 
soft-voiced patter 
that pointed 
out necessities 
and weaknesses, 
pitfalls and strengt
hs. Once, when he had to 
reach across 
the board to the back rank and move a rook from its home 
square, she was astonished 
to see as he stretched 
his body 
that he was carrying 
a knife at his waist. 
The leather-andÂ­
metal handle 
protruded 
above his belt. He looked so much 
like someone 
out of 
Treasure Island that the knife did not 
seem out of 
place. 
Just then he paused in his moving and 
said, " Now watch this, " and brought 
the black rook up to 
its king five square, setting 
it down with 
a muted flourish. 
He folded his arms across 
his chest. 
" What does White do 
here?" he asked, 
looking 
around him. 
Beth considered 
the board. 
There were pitfalls all 
over 
for white. 
One of the men watching 
spoke up. " Queen 
takes pawn?" 

. 1 26 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

The man in the cap shook 
his head, smiling. 
"Rook to 
king eight 
check. 
And the queen falls . " 
Beth had seen that. It looked to be all over for the white 
pieces 
and she started 
to say so when another 
man spoke 
up. "That's Mieses-Reshevsky. From the thirties
. " 
The man looked up at him. " You' ve got it, " he said. 
"Margate. Nineteen thirty-f
ive." 
"White played rook to queen one , " the first man said. 
"Right," said the other. "What else has he 
got?" He made 
the move and continued. 
It was clear now 
that White was 
losing. 
There were some fast trades 
and then an endgame 
that looked for a moment as though it might be slow, but 
Black made a striking 
sacrifice of a passed pawn and 
abruptly 
the topology 
of pawn-queening 
made it clear that 
Black would have a queen two moves before White. 
It was a 
dazzling 
game, like 
some of the best ones Beth had 
learned 
from books. 
The man stood 
up, took off his cap and 
stretched
. He 
looked down 
at Beth for a 
moment. ' 'Reshevsky 
was 
playing 
like that when he was your 
age, little 
girl. Younger. " 

Enquirer. 

Back in the room Mrs . Wheatley 
was still 
reading 
the 
She looked over her reading 
glasses 
at Beth as 
she came in the door. "Finished 
already?" she said. 
"Yes . " 
"How did you do?" 
"I won . " 
Mrs. Wheatley 
smiled warm! y. "Honey , " she said, 
' 'you are a treasur
e . ' ' 

Mrs . Wheatley 
had seen an 
ad about a sale at Shillit
o's-a 
department 
store a few blocks from 
the Gibson. 
Since 
there were four hours before Beth's next game, 
they went 

1 27 

WALTER TEVIS 

over, through 
lightly 
falling snow, and Mrs. Wheatley 
rummaged 
in the basement 
awhile until Beth said, "I'd 
like to look at their sweaters. " 
" What kind of sweaters , 
dear?" 
" Cashmere. " 
Mrs. Wheatley
' s eyebrows went 
up. "Cashmere? 
Are 
you sure we can afford it?'' 
" Yes . " 
Beth found a pale-gray sweater 
on sale 
for twenty-four 
dollars, 
and it fit her perfectly. Looking 
in the tall mirror, 
she tried to imagine 
herself 
as a member of the Apple Pi 
Club, like Margaret; 
but the face was still 
Beth' s face, 
round and freckled, 
with straight 
brown hair. 
She shrugged 
and bought the sweater with a traveler's 
check. They had 
passed 
an elegant 
little 
shoe store with saddle 
oxfords 
in the 
o's and she took Mrs. Wheatley 
window on the way to Shillit
there and bought herself 
a pair. Then she bought argyle 
socks 
to go with them. The tag 
said: " 100% wool. Made in EngÂ­
land. " Going back to the hotel through 
a wind that whipped 
tiny snowflakes 
against 
her, Beth kept 
looking 
down at her 
new shoes 
and high plaid socks. 
She liked the 
way her feet 
felt, liked the tightness 
of the warm socks against 
her calves, 
and liked the way 
they looked-bright expensive 
socks above 
bright 
brown-and-white 
shoes. 
She kept looking 
down. 

That afternoon she was matched 
with a middle-aged 
Ohioan 
with a rating 
of 1 9 10. She played the Sicilian 
and forced 
him to resign 
after an hour and a half. Her mind was as 
clear as it had ever been, and she was able to use some of 
the things 
she had 
learned over the past weeks from studyÂ­
ing her new book 
by the Russian master 
Boleslavski. 
When she turned in her score sheet Sizemore was stand-

1 2 8 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

ing near the desk. She saw 
a few other 
familiar faces from 
that tournament, 
and it felt good to see them, but she 
really 
wanted to see only one 
player 
from before-Townes. 
She looked several 
times but 
didn' t find him. 
Back in 
their room that evening, 
Mrs. Wheatley 
watched 

The Beverly Hillbillies 
and The Dick Van Dyke 
Show, 

while Beth set up and went over 
her two 
games, looking 
for weaknesses 
in her play. There weren't any. Then she 
got out the book by Reuben Fine on endgames 
and began 
studying. The endgame 
in chess had its own feeling; 
it was 
like an altogether 
different contest, once you got 
down to a 
piece or two on each side and the question 
became one of 
queening 
a pawn. It could be agonizingly subtle; there 
was 
no chance for the kind of 
violent 
attack 
Beth loved. 
But she was bored with Reuben Fine, and after a while she 
closed 
the book and went to bed. She had two 
of the little 
green pills in 
her pajama pocket, 
and she 
took them 
after the 
lights 
were off. She didn' t want to risk not 
sleeping. 
The second day was as easy as the first, even though 
Beth was matched 
against 
stronger players. 
It had taken 
her a while to clear her head from the effect of the pills, 
but by the time she started 
playing 
her mind was sharp. 
She even 
handled 
the pieces 
themselves 
with confidence, 
picking 
them up and setting 
them down with 
aplomb. 
There was no ' 'Top Boards' ' room at this tournament. 
Board One was merely the first 
board at the first 
table. 
For 
the second game Beth was at Board Six, and people were 
gathered 
around her as she forced 
the master to resign 
after 
taking 
one of his rooks. When she looked up during the 
applause, 
there stood Alma Wheatley 
at the back of the 
room smiling 
broadly. 
In her final game, at Board One, Beth was playing 
a 

1 29 

WALTER TEVIS 

master named Rudolph. 
He managed 
to start trading 
pieces 
in the center 
during 
the middle game, and Beth was alarmed 
to find herself 
crowded into an ending with a rook, a 
knight and three pawns. Rudolph 
had the 
same thing, 
except for a 
bishop 
where she had a knight. 
She didn't like 
it, and his bishop was a distinct 
advantage
. But she manÂ­
aged to pin it and trade her knight 
for it and then play with 
great care for an hour and a half until 
Rudolph 
made a 
blunder 
and she zeroed in on it. She checked with a 
pawn, 
traded 
rooks and got one of her pawns passed 
with the king 
protecting. Rudolph 
looked furious at himself 
and resigned
. 
There was strong applause. 
Beth looked at the crowd 
around the table. Near the back, in her 
blue dress, was 
Mrs . Wheatley, clapping 
her hands enthusiastic
ally. 
Going back to the roo
m, Mrs. Wheatley 
carried 
the 
heavy trophy 
and Beth had the check in her blouse 
pocket. 
Mrs . Wheatley 
had written 
it all out on a sheet of hotel 
stationery 
that sat on top of the TV: sixty-six 
dollars for 
three days at the Gibson, 
plus three-thirty 
tax; twenty-three 
sixty for the bus, and the price of each meal, including 
tip. 
"I've allowed 
twelve dollars for our celebration 
supper 
tonight 
and two dollars for a small breakfast 
tomorrow. 
That makes 
our total expenses equal 
one seventy-two 
thirty . ' ' 
"It leaves 
over three hundred 
dollars, " Beth said. 
There was a silence for a while. Beth looked 
at the sheet 
of paper, although 
she understood 
it perfectly we
l l . She 
was wondering 
if she 
should 
offer to split the money with 
Mrs . Wheatley
. She did not 
want to do that. 
She had won 
it herself. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
broke the silence. 
"Perhaps you could 
give me ten percent, " she said pleasant
ly. " As an agent's 
commission
. " 
' 'Thirty -two dollars,'' Beth said, ' 'and seventy-seven 
cents . ' ' 

1 30 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

' 'They told me at Methuen 
that you were marvelous at 
math . ' ' 
Beth nodded. "Okay, " she said. 

They had something 
with veal in it at an Italian 
restaurant. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
ordered 
herself 
a carafe of red wine and 
drank it and smoked 
Chesterfields throughout 
the meal. 
Beth liked the 
bread and the cold, pale butter. She 
liked 
the little 
tree with oranges 
on it that sat on the bar, not far 
from their table. 
Mrs . Wheatley 
wiped her chin with her 
napkin 
when she 
finished 
the wine and lit a final cigarette. "Beth, dear , " 
she said, "there ' s a tournament 
i n Houston 
over the holiÂ­
days, starting 
the twenty-sixth . I understand 
it's very easy 
to travel 
on Christmas 
Day, since most people 
are eating 
plum pudding 
or whatever
. " 
" I saw , " Beth said. She had read the 
ad in Chess 
Review and wanted very much to go. But Houston had 
seemed awfully far away for a six-hundred-dollar 
prize. 
"I believe 
we could fly to Houston, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said brightly. " We could have a pleasant 
winter vacation 
in the sun.' ' 
Beth was finishing 
her spumoni. 
"Okay, " she said and 
then, looking 
down at the 
ice cream, "Okay, Mother. " 

Their Christmas 
dinner 
was microwave 
turkey served on 
an airplane, 
with a complimentary 
glass of champagne 
for 
Mrs . Wheatley 
and canned orange 
juice for Beth. It was 
the best 
Christmas 
she had ever 
had. The plane 
flew over a 
snow-covered Kentucky 
and, at the end of the trip, circled 
out above the Gulf of Mexico. They landed in warm air 
and sunshine. 
Driving 
in from the airport, they 
passed 
one 
construction 
site after the other, 
the big yellow cranes 
and 

1 3 1 

WALTER TEVIS 

is national 

bulldozers standing 
idle near stacks 
of girders
. Someone 
had hung a Christmas 
wreath on one of them. 
A week before they left Lexington 
a new copy of Chess 
Review had come in the mail. When Beth opened it 
she 
found a small picture of herself 
and Beltik at the back,

SCHOOLGIRL 
TAKES KENTUCKY 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
FROM MASTER
. Their game was printed 
and 
the commentary said: ' 'Onlookers were amazed at her 
youthful 
mastery 
of the fine points 
of strategy. She shows 
the assurance 
of players twice her age . " She read it twice 
before showing 
it to Mrs. Wheatley. Mrs . Wheatley 
was 
ecstatic
; she had read the article 
in the Lexington 
paper 
aloud and then said " Wonderful! " This time she read in 
silence 
before saying, "This 
recognition, 
dear," 
in a hushed voice. 
Mrs . Wheatley 
had brought 
the magazine 
with her, and 
they spent part of 
the time on 
the plane 
marking 
the 
tournaments 
Beth would play over the next several 
months. 
They settled 
on one a month; Mrs . Wheatley 
was afraid 
they would run out of diseases 
and, as she said, ' 'credibilÂ­
ity'' if she wrote more 
excuses 
than that. Beth wondered 
to herself 
if they shouldn't just ask for permission 
in a 
straightforward 
way-after 
all, boys were allowed 
to miss 
classes 
for basketball and football-but 
she was wise 
enough 
to say nothing. 
Mrs . Wheatley 
seemed to take immense 
enjoyment 
in doing it this 
way. It was like a conspira
cy. 
She won in Houston 
without 
any trouble. 
She was, as 
Mrs. Wheatley 
said, really 
"getting 
the hang of it. " She 
was forced to draw her third game 
but took the 
final one 
by a dazzling 
combinat
ion, beating 
the forty-year-old 
SouthÂ­
west Champion 
as though he were a beginner. 
They stayed 
over two days "for the sun" and visited 
the Museum of 
Fine Arts 
and the Zoological 
Gardens. On the day after the 

1 3 2 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

tournament 
Beth's picture was in the paper, 
and this time 
it made her 
feel good to see it. 
The article 
called 
her a 
"Wunderkind. " Mrs. Wheatley 
bought three copies, saying, 
' ' I just might start a scrapbook. 
' ' 

In January, Mrs. Wheatley 
called 
the school 
to say 
that 
Beth had a relapse 
of mono, and they went to Charleston. 
In February 
it was Atlanta and 
a cold; in March, Miami 
and the flu . Sometimes 
Mrs. Wheatley 
talked 
to the AssisÂ­
tant Principal 
and sometimes 
to the Dean 
of Girls. No one 
questioned 
the excuses. It seemed likely 
that some of the 
students 
knew about 
her from out-of-town 
papers 
or someÂ­
thing, 
but no one in authority 
said anything. 
Beth worked 
on her chess for three 
hours every evening 
between 
tournaÂ­
ments. 
She lost one game in Atlanta 
but still 
came in 
first, 
and she stayed undefeated 
in the other two 
cities. She 
enjoyed 
flying 
with Mrs. Wheatley, 
who sometimes 
beÂ­
came comfortably 
buzzed by martinis 
on the planes. They 
talked and giggled 
together. 
Mrs . Wheatley 
said funny 
things about 
the stewarde
sses and their beautifully 
pressed 
jackets and bright, 
artificial makeup, or talked 
about how 
silly some of her 
neighbors 
in Lexington 
were. She was 
high-spi
rited and confidential 
and amusing, 
and Beth would 
laugh a long time and look out 
the window at the clouds 
below them and feel better 
than she had 
ever felt, even 
during 
those times at Methuen 
when she had saved up her 
green pills 
and taken five or 
six at once. 
She grew to love hotels and 
restaurants 
and the 
exciteÂ­
ment of being in a tournament 
and winning it, moving 
up 
gradually 
game by game and having 
the crowd around her 
table increase 
with each win
. People at 
tournaments 
knew 
who she was now. She was always 
the youngest 
there, and 

1 33 

WALTER TEVIS 

sometimes 
the only 
female. Back at school 
afterward things 
seemed more and more drab. Some of 
the other students 
talked 
about going to college 
after high school, and some 
had prof
essions 
in mind. Two girls she knew wanted to be 
nurses. Beth never participa
ted in these conversati
ons; she 
already 
was what she wanted to be. But she talked 
to no 
one about her traveling or about the 
reputation 
she was 
building in 
tournament 
chess. 
When they came back 
from Miami in March, there was 
an envelope 
from the Chess Federation 
in the mail. In it 
was a new membership 
card with her 
rating: 
1 88 1 . She 
had been told it 
would take time 
for the rating 
to reflect 
her real strength
; she was satisfied for now to be, finally, a 
rated player. 
She would push the figure 
up soon enough. 
The next big step was Master, 
at 2200. After 2000 they 
called 
you an Expert, 
but that didn't mean much. The one 
she liked was International 
Grandmaster; 
that had weight 
to it. 

That summer they went to New York to play at 
the Henry 
Hudson Hotel. They had 
developed 
a taste for fine food, 
though at home 
it was mostly TV dinners, 
and in New 
York they ate 
at French restauran
ts , taking 
buses crossÂ­
town toLe Bistro and Cafe Argenteuil. Mrs . 
Wheatley 
had 
gone to a gas station 
in Lexington 
and bought a Mobil 
Travel Guide; she picked places 
with three or more stars, 
and then they found them with the little map. It was 
terribly 
expensive, 
but neither 
of them said a word about 
the cost. Beth would eat smoked trout but never fresh fish; 
she remembered 
the fish she'd had to 
eat on Fridays 
at 
Methuen. She decided 
that next 
year at school 
she would 
take French. 

1 34 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

The only problem was 
that, on the road, she took 
the 
pills 
from Mrs. Wheatley's prescription 
to help her sleep 
at 
night, 
and sometimes 
it required 
an hour or so to get her 
head clear in the morning. But tournament 
games never 
started 
before nine, and she made 
a point of getting 
up in 
time to have several 
cups of coffee from room service
. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
did not know about the 
pills 
and showed no 
concern over Beth's appetite 
for coffee; she treated 
her in 
every way like an adult. 
Sometimes 
it seemed as though 
Beth were the older of the 
two. 
Beth loved New York. She liked riding 
on the bus, and 
she liked taking 
the IRT 
subway with its grit and rattle . 
She liked window shopping 
when she had 
a chance, and 
she enjoyed 
hearing 
people 
on the street 
talking 
Yiddish 
or 
Spanish. She did not mind the sense of danger in the city 
or the arrogant 
way the taxis drove or the dirty glitter of 
Times Square. They went to Radio City Music Hall on 
their last 
and the Rockettes. 
Sitting 
high in the cavernous 
theater 
in a velvet 
seat, Beth 
was thrilled. 

night and saw West Side Story 

She had expected a 
reporter 
from Life to be someone 
who 
chain-sm
oked and looked like Lloyd Nolan
, but the person 
who came to the door of the house was a small woman 
with steel-gray hair and a dark dress. The man with 
her 
was carrying 
a camera. 
She introduced herself 
as Jean 
Balke. She looked older than Mrs
. Wheatley, and she 
walked around the living 
room with quick little 
moveÂ­
ments, 
hastily 
checking 
out the books in the bookcase 
and 
studying 
some of the prints 
on the walls. Then she 
began 
asking question
s . Her manner was pleasant and direct. 
"I've really 
been impressed
, " she said, "even though I 

1 35 

WALTER TEVIS 

don' t play chess myself." She smiled. 
"They say 
you're 
the real thing. 
' ' 
Beth was a little 
embarrassed. 
"How does it feel? Being a girl among all those men?" 
"I don' t mind it. " 
"Isn ' t it frightening?" They were sitting 
facing each 
other. 
Miss Balke leaned 
forward, looking 
intently 
at Beth. 
Beth shook her head. The photographer 
came over to 
the sofa and began taking 
readings 
with a meter. 
" When I was a girl, " the 
reporter said, "I 
was never 
allowed 
to be competitive. 
I used to 
play with 
dolls.' ' 
The photographer backed 
off and began to study Beth 
through 
his camera. She remembered 
the doll Mr. 
Ganz 
had given her. 
"Chess isn't always 'competitive
, ' " she 
said. 
"But you play to win . " 
Beth wanted to say something 
about how beautiful 
chess 
was sometimes, 
but she looked at Miss Balke's sharp, 
inquiring 
face and couldn' t find the words for it. 
" Do you have 
a boyfriend?" 
"No. I'm fourteen. " The photographer 
began snapping 
pictures. 
Miss Balke had lighted 
a cigarette
. She leaned 
forward 
now and tapped the ashes into one 
of Mrs. Wheatley
's 
ashtray
s . " Are you interested 
in boys?" she asked. 
Beth was feeling more and more uneasy. She wanted to 
talk about learning chess and about the tournaments 
she 
had won and about people like Morphy and Capablanca. 
She did n.ot like this woman and did not like her 
questions
. 
"I'm interested 
in chess mostly. " 
Miss Balke smiled brightly. "Tell me about it," she said. 
"Tell me how you learned to play and how old you were . " 

1 36 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

Beth told 
her and Miss Balke took notes, but Beth felt 
that she wasn't really 
interested 
in any 
of it. She found as 
she went on talking 
that she really 
had very little 
to say. 
The next week at school, during 
algebra 
class. Beth saw 
the boy 
in front of her pass a copy of Life to the girl 
next 
to him, and they both 
turned and looked back at her as 
though they had never seen her 
before. After class the boy, 
who had never 
spoken to her before, stopped 
her and 
asked if she 
would autograph 
the magazine
. Beth was 
stunned. She took it from him and there it was, filling a 
full page. There was a picture 
of her looking 
serious 
at her 
chessboard, and there was another picture 
of the main 
building 
at Methuen. Across the 
top of the page 
a headline 
read: A GIRL MOZART STARTLES 
THE WORLD OF CHESS. 
She signed 
her name with the 
boy's ball-point 
pen, setting 
the magazine 
on an empty desk. 
When she got home, Mrs . Wheatley 
had the magazine 
in her lap. She began reading 
aloud: 
" 'With some people 
chess is a pastime, 
with others 
it 
is a compulsion, even an addiction. And every now and 
then a person comes along 
for whom it is a birthright. 
Now and then a small boy appears 
and dazzles 
us with his 
precocity 
at what may 
be the world's most difficult game. 
But what if that boy were a girl-a young, unsmiling 
girl 
with brown ey
es, brown hair and a dark-blue 
dress? 
" ' It has never happened 
before, but it happened reÂ­
cently. In Lexington, 
Kentucky
, and in Cincinnati
. In 
Charleston, 
Atlanta, 
Miami, and lately in New York 
City. 
Into the male-domina
ted world of the nation' s top chess

strolls 
a fourteen-year-old 
with bright, 
intense 
eyes, from eighth 
grade at Fairfield Junior 
High in LexingÂ­
ton , Kentucky. She is quiet and 
well-mannered. And she is

out for blood . . . ' It's marvelous
! " Mrs. Wheatley 
said. 
" Shall I read 
on?" 
"It talks about the orphanage. " Beth had 
bought her 
own copy. "And it gives one of my games. But it' s mostly 
about my being a girl . ' ' 
"Well, you are one . " 
"It shouldn't be that importa
nt," Beth said. "They 
didn't print half 
the things 
I told them. They 
didn't tell 
about Mr. Shaibel. They didn't say anything 
about how I 
play the Sicilia
n .' ' 
" But, Beth , " Mrs. Wheatley 
said, "it makes you a 

celebrity
! ' ' 

Beth looked at her thoughtf
ully. " For being a girl, 
mostly, ' ' she said. 

The next day 
Margaret 
stopped 
her in the hall. Margaret 
was wearing 
a camel's-hair 
coat and her blond hair fell just 
to her shoulders; 
she was 
even more beautiful 
than she had 
been a year before, when 
Beth had taken the ten dollars 
from her purse. "The 
other Apple Pi' s asked me to invite 
you , " Margaret 
said respectf
ully. "We're having 
a pledge 
party Friday 
night at my house . ' ' 
The Apple Pi' s . I t was very strange. When Beth acÂ­
cepted and asked for the address 
she realized 
it was the 
first 
time she had 
ever actually spoken to Margaret. 
She spent over 
an hour that afternoon trying 
on dresses 
at Purcell's before picking 
a navy-blue 
with a simple white 
collar from the store's most expensive 
line. When she 
showed it to Mrs. Wheatley 
that evening and 
told her she 
was going to the Apple Pi Club, Mrs. Wheatley 
was 
clearly 
pleased. " You look just like a debutante
! " she 
said when Beth tried on the dress for her. 

1 38 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT

The white woodwork of 
Margaret' s living 
room glistened 
beautif
ully and the 
pictures 
on the walls were oil paintings
Â­
mostly of 
horses. Even though it was a mild evening 
in 
March, a big fire burned under the white mantel . Fourteen 
girls were sitting 
on the white sofas and colored wingback 
chairs 
when Beth arrived 
in her new 
dress. Most of the 
others were wearing 
sweaters 
and skirts. " It was really 
something, " one of them said, "to find a face from FairÂ­
field Junior 
High in Life. I nearly 
flipped
! " but when Beth 
started to talk about the tournaments, the girls interrupted 
her to ask about the boys at them. Were they goodÂ­
looking? 
Did she date any of them? 
When Beth 
said, 
"There ' s not 
much time for that," the girls changed 
the 
subject. 
For an hour or more they talked about boys and dating 
and clothes, 
veering 
erratically 
from cool sophistication 
to 
giggles, 
while Beth sat uneasily 
at one end of a sofa 
holding 
a crystal 
glass of Coca-Col
a, unable to think of 
anything 
to say. Then, at nine o'clock, 
Margaret turned on 
the huge television 
set by the fireplace 
and they were all 
quiet, 
except for an occasional 
giggle, 
while the "Movie 
of the Week" came on. 
Beth sat through 
it, not participating 
in the gossip 
and 
laughter during 
the commercials, until it ended at eleven. 
She was astounded 
at the dullness 
of the evening. This 
was 
the elite 
Apple Pi Club that had seemed so important 
when 
she first went to 
school 
in Lexingto
n , and this was what 
they did at their sophistic
ated parties: they watched 
a 
Charles 
Bronson 
movie. The only break in the dullness 
was when a girl named Felicia 
said, "I wonder if he's as 

1 39 

WALTER TEVIS 

well-hung 
as he looks. " Beth laughed 
at that, but 
it was 
the only 
thing she laughed 
at. 
When she left after eleven 
no one urged her to stay, and 
no one said anything 
about her joining
. She was relieved 
to get into the taxi and go home, and when she got there 
she spent an hour in her room with The Middle Game 
Chess, translated 
from the Russian 
of D . Luchenko
. 

in 

The school knew about her, 
well enough, 
by the next 
tournament, 
and this time she 
hadn' t claimed 
illness 
as an 
excuse. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
talked 
to the principal, and Beth 
was excused from her 
classes
. Nothing 
was said about the 
illnesses 
she had lied about. 
They wrote her up in the 
school 
paper, 
and people 
pointed 
her out in 
the hallways. 
The tournament 
was in Kansas City, and after she won 
it 
the director 
took her and Mrs. Wheatley 
to a steakhouse 
for dinner and told her they were 
honored 
to have her 
participate
. He was a serious 
young man, and he treated 
both of them politely. 
" I'd like to play in the U . S . Open, " Beth said over 
dessert 
and coffee. 
" Sure , " he said. " You might win it. " 
" Would that lead to playing 
abroad?" Mrs. Wheatley 
asked. "In Europe, I mean?'' 
" No reason why 
not , " the young man said
. His name 
was Nobile. 
He wore thick glasses 
and kept drinking 
ice 
water. "They 
have to know about you before they invite 
you . ' ' 
" Would winning 
the Open make them 
know about me?" 
"Sure. Benny Watts plays in Europe all the time, 
now 
that he's got his international 
title. "

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

"How's the prize 
money?" Mrs. Wheatley asked
, light-
ing a cigarette. 
"Pretty good, I think. " 
"What about Russia?" 
Beth said. 
Nobile stared at 
her a minute, 
as though 
she had sugÂ­
gested something 
illicit. 
"Russia's murder," he said 
fiÂ­
nally. ' 'They eat Americans 
for breakfast over 
there.' ' 
"Now, really . . . " Mrs . Wheatley 
said. 
"They really do
, " Nobile 
said. " I don't think there
' s 
been an American 
with a prayer against 
the Russians 
for 
twenty years . It
's like ballet. 
They pay people to play 
chess. " 
Beth thought 
of those pictures in Chess Review, 
of the 
men with 
grim faces, bending 
over chessboards-Borgov 
and Tal, Laev arid Shapkin , scowling
, wearing 
dark suits. 
Chess in Russia 
was a different thing than chess in AmerÂ­
ica. Finally 
she asked, 
"How do I get in the U . S . Open?" 
"Just send in an entry fee, " Nobile said. "It's 
like any 
other tournament, except 
the competiti
on's stiffer. " 

She sent in her entry fee, but she did not play in the U . S . 
Open that year. Mrs. Wheatley 
developed 
a virus that kept 
her in bed for 
two weeks
, and Beth, who had just passed 
her fifteenth 
birthday, was unwilling 
to go alone. 
She did 
her best 
to hide it, but she was furious at Alma Wheatley 
for being sick, and at herself 
for being 
afraid to make the 
trip to Los Angeles. The Open was not 
as important 
as the 
U . S . Championship
, but it was time she started playing 
in 
something 
other than 
events 
chosen solely 
on the 
basis of 
the prize money. There was a tight little world 
of tournaÂ­
ments like the United States 
Championship 
and the MerÂ­
riwether 
Invitational 
that she knew of through 
overheard 

1 4 1 

WALTER TEVIS 

in Chess Review; it was 

conversations 
and from articles 
time she got into it, and then into international 
chess. 
Sometimes 
she would visualize 
herself 
as what she wanted 
to become; a truly professional 
woman and the finest 
chessplayer 
in the world, 
traveling 
confidently 
by herself 
in the first-class 
cabins 
of airplanes, 
tal l , 
perfectly dressed, 
good-looking 
and poised-a kind of 
white Jolene. 
She 
often told herself 
that she would send Jolene 
a card or a 
letter, but she never 
did. Instead she would study herself 
in 
the bathroom 
mirror, 
looking 
for signs of that poised 
and 
beautiful 
woman she wanted to 
become. 
At sixteen 
she had grown taller 
and better-
looking, had 
learned to have her hair cut in a way that showed her eyes 
to some advantage, 
but she 
still 
looked like a schoolgirl
. 
She played tournaments 
about every six weeks now-in 
states 
like Illinois 
and Tennessee, 
and sometimes 
in New 
York. They still 
chose ones 
that would pay enough to 
show a profit 
after the 
expenses 
for the two of them. Her 
bank account 
grew, and that was a considerable 
pleasure, 
but somehow her career 
seemed to be on a plateau
. And 
she was too old to be called 
a prodigy 
anymore.

CHAPTER 6 

Although 
the U . S . Open was being held 
in Las Vegas, the 
other people at the Mariposa 
Hotel seemed oblivious 
to it. 
In the main 
room the players 
at the craps tables, at roulette 
and at 
the blackjack tables wore 
brightly 
colored doubleÂ­
knits and shirts; they went about their 
business 
in silence. 
On the other side of the casino 
was the hotel coffee shop. 
The day before the 
tournament 
Beth walked down an aisle 
between 
crapshooters 
where the main sound was the tapÂ­
ping of clay 
chips and of dice on felt. In the coffee shop 
she slid 
onto a stool at the counter, 
turned around to look 
at the mostly empty booths 
and saw 
a handsome 
young 
man sitting 
hunched 
over a cup of coffee, alone. It 
was 
Townes, 
from Lexington. 
She stood up and went over to the 
booth. 
' 'Hello,' ' she 
said.

er." 

Chess Review 

He looked up and blinked, 
not recognizing 
her at first. 
Then he said, "Harmon! For Christ's 
sake! " 
"Can I sit down?" 
"Sure , " he said. "I should 
have known 
you. You were 
on the list. 
' ' 
' 'The list? ' ' 
"The tournament 
list. 
I ' m not playing. 
sent me to write it up. " He looked at her. "I could 
write 
you up. For the Herald-Lead
"Lexington?" 
" You got it. You've grown a lot, Harmon. I saw the 
piece in Life ." He looked at her 
closely. 
" You' ve even 
gotten 
good-looking
. " 
She felt flustered 
and did not know what to say. EveryÂ­
thing about Las Vegas was strange. On the table in each 
booth was a lamp with 
a glass base filled with purple 
liquid 
that bubbled 
and swirled below 
its bright 
pink shade. 
The waitress 
who handed her a menu was dressed 
in a 
black miniskirt and 
fishnet 
hose, but she had 
the face of a 
geometry 
teacher. Townes 
was handsome, 
smiling, 
dressed 
in a dark sweater with a striped 
shirt open at 
the throat. 
She chose the Mariposa Special: 
hot cakes, scrambled eggs 
and chili peppers with 
the Bottomless 
Cup of coffee. 
"I could do half a 
page on you for the Sunday paper , " 
Townes was saying. 
The hot cakes and eggs came, and Beth 
ate them and 
drank two cups of coffee. 
"I've got a camera in my room, " Townes said. He 
hesitated. ' 'I 've got chessboards, too. Do you want 
to 
play?'' 
She shrugged. "Okay. Let's go up. " 
"Terrific! " His smile was dazzling. 

1 44 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

The drapes were 
open, with a view of 
a parking lot. The 
bed was huge and unmade. 
It seemed to fill the room. 
There were three chessboards 
set up: one on a table by the 
window, 
one on the bur
eau, and the third in the bathroom 
next to the basin. 
He posed her 
by the window and shot a 
roll of film while she sat at the board and moved the 
pieces. 
It was difficult 
not to look at him as he walked 
around. When he came close to her 
and held a little 
light 
meter near her face, she found herself catching 
her breath 
at the sensation 
of warmth from his body. Her heart was 
beating 
fast, and when she reached 
out to move a rook she 
saw that her fingers 
were trembling. 
He clicked 
off the last shot 
and began rewinding 
the 
film. ' 'One of those should do it,' ' he said. He set the 
camera on the nightstand 
by the bed. " Let' s play chess. " 
She looked at him. " I don't know what your 
first name 
is.' ' 
"Everyone 
calls me Townes, " he said. " Maybe that's 
why I call you Harmon. Instead 
of Elizabeth. " 
She began setting 
up the pieces on the board. " It's 
Beth.' ' 
"I'd rather 
call you Hannon. " 
"Lefs play skittles
, " she said. " You can 
play White. " 
Skittles 
was speed chess, and there wasn' t time for 
much complexity
. He got his chess clock from the bureau 
and set it to give them each five minutes. 
"I should 
give 
you three, " he said. 
"Go ahead, " Beth said, not 
looking 
at him. She wished 
he would just come over 
and touch her--on the arm 
maybe, or put his hand on her cheek. 
He seemed terribly 
sophisticated, 
and his smile was 
easy. He couldn' t be 
thinking 
about her the way 
she was thinking about 
him.

But Jolene had said, "They all think about it, honey. 
That's just what they think about. " And they were alone 
in his 
room, with the 
king-si
zed bed. In Las Vegas. 
When he set the clock at the side of 
the board, she saw 
they both had the same amount of time. She did not want 
to play this game with him. 
She wanted to make love with 
him. She punched the 
button on her side, and his clock 
started 
ticking. 
He moved pawn to king four and pushed 
his button. She held her breath 
for a moment and began to 
play chess. 

When Beth came back to their room Mrs. Wheatley 
was 
sitting 
in bed, smoking 
a cigarette and looking mournf
ul. 
" Where've you been, honey?" 
she said. Her voice was 
quiet and had some 
of the strain 
it had when 
she spoke 
of 
Mr. Wheatley. 
' ' Playing 
chess, ' ' Beth said. ' ' Practicing. ' ' 
There was a copy of Chess Review o n the television 
set. 
Beth got it and opened it to the masthead 
page. His name 
wasn't among the editors
, but down below, under "CorreÂ­
spondents
," were three names; the third was D . L. Townes. 
She still 
didn't know his first name. 
After a moment Mrs. Wheatley 
said, " Would you hand 
me a can of beer? On the dresser.' ' 
Beth stood up. Five cans of Pabst were 
on one of the 
brown trays room service 
used, and a half-eaten 
bag of 
potato 
chips. " Why don't you 
have one yourself?" 
Mrs . 
Wheatley 
said. 
Beth picked 
up two cans; they felt metallic 
and cold. 
" Okay . " She handed them to Mrs. Wheatley 
and got 
herself 
a clean glass from 
the bathroom. 

1 46 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

When Beth 
gave her the glass, Mrs. Wheatley 
said, "I 
guess you've never had 
a beer before. " 
"I'm sixteen. " 
"Well . . . " Mrs . Wheatley 
frowned. She lifted the tab 
with a little 
pop and poured expertly 
into Beth' s glass 
until the white 
collar stood above the rim. "Here , " she 
said, as though offering medicine. 
Beth sipped 
the beer. She had never had it before but it 
tasted 
much as she had 
expected, 
as though she had 
alÂ­
ways known 
what beer would taste 
like. She tried not to 
make a face and finished 
almost half 
the glass. 
Mrs. 
Wheatley 
reached 
out from the bed 
and poured the rest of 
it in. Beth drank another 
mouthful. It stung her throat 
slightly
, but then she felt a sensation 
of warmth in her 
stomach. Her face was flushed-as 
though she were blushÂ­
ing. She finished 
off the glassfu l . "Goodness, " Mrs. 
Wheatley 
said, "you shouldn' t drink so fast. " 
"I'd like another," Beth said. She was thinking 
of 
Townes, how he had looked after they finished 
playing 
and she stood up to leave
. He had smiled and taken her 
hand. Just holding 
his hand for that short time made her 
cheeks feel the way the beer 
had. She had won seven fast 
games from him. She held 
her glass tightly 
and for a 
moment wanted 
to throw it on the floor as hard as she 
could and watch it shatter. 
Instead she walked over, picked 
up another can 
of beer, put her finger 
in the ring and 
opened it. 
" You really 
shouldn't 
. . . " Mrs. Wheatley 
said. Beth 
filled 
her glass. " Well, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said, resigned, 
" if you're going 
to do that, let 
me have one 
too. I just 
don't want you to 
be sick . . . " 
Beth banged 
her shoulder 
against 
the door frame going 

1 47 

WALTER TEVIS 

into the 
bathroom 
and barely 
got to the toilet 
in time. It 
stung her nose horribly as she threw up. After she finÂ­
ished, she stood by 
the toilet for 
a while and began to cry. 
Yet, even while she was crying, she knew that 
she had 
made a discovery 
with the three cans of 
beer, a discovery 
as important as the one she had made when she was eight 
years old and saved up her green pills 
and then took them 
all at one time. With the pills 
there was 
a long wait before 
the swooning 
came into her 
stomach 
and loosened 
the 
tightness. The beer gave her 
the same feeling with almost 
no wait. 
" No more beer, honey, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said when 
Beth came back into the bedroom. "Not until you
're 
eighteen
. ' ' 

The ballroom 
was set up for seventy 
chess players , and 
Beth ' s first 
game was at Board Nine, against 
a small man 
from Oklahoma. 
She beat him as if in a dream, in two 
dozen moves. That afternoon, at Board Four, she crushed 
the defenses 
of a serious 
young man from New York, 
playing 
the King's Gambit and sacrificing the bishop the 
way Paul Morphy 
had done. 
Benny Watts was in his 
twentie
s, but he looked nearly 
as young as Beth. He was not 
much taller, 
either. 
Beth 
saw him from time to 
time during the 
tournament. He 
started 
at Board One and stayed there; 
people said he was 
the best American 
player since Morphy
. Beth stood near 
him once at the Coke machine, 
but they did not speak. 
He 
was talking 
to another 
male player and smiling 
a lot; they 
were amiably 
debating 
the virtues of the 
Semi-Slav 
deÂ­
fense. Beth had 
made a study of the Semi-Slav 
a few days 
before, and she had a good deal 
to say about it, but she 

1 48 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

remained 
silent, 
got her Coke and walked 
away. Listening 
to the two of them, she had felt something 
unpleasant 
and 
familiar: 
the sense that chess was a thing between 
men , 
and she was a n outsider. 
She hated the feeling. 
Watts was wearing 
a white shirt 
open at 
the collar, 
with 
the sleeves 
rolled 
up. His face was both cheerful 
and sly. 
With his flat straw-col
ored hair he looked as American 
as 
Huckleberry Finn, yet there was something 
untrustworthy 
about his eyes. He, too, had been 
a child prodigy 
and that, 
besides 
the fact that he was Champion, 
made Beth uneasy. 
She remembered 
a Watts game book with a 
draw against 
Borstmann 
and a caption 
reading 
"Copenhagen: 
1 948. " 
That meant Benny had been eight years old-the age Beth 
was when she was playing 
Mr. Shaibel 
in the basement. 
In 
the middle of that book was a photograph 
of him at 
thirteen, standing 
solemnly 
at a long table facing 
a group 
of uniformed 
midshipmen 
seated at chessboards; 
he had 
played against 
the twenty-three-man 
team at Annapolis 
without 
losing 
a game. 
When she came back with 
her empty Coke bottle, 
he 
was still standing 
by the machine. 
He looked at her. 
"Hey , " he said pleasan
tly, "you're Beth Harmon. " 
She put the bottle 
in the case. " Yes . " 
" I saw the piece in Life," he said
. "The game they 
printed 
was a pretty 
one." It was the game she'd won 
against Beltik. 
"Thanks, " she said. 
' 'I'm Benny Watts. " 
' 'I know . ' ' 
" You shouldn't have castled, 
though, " he said 
smiling. 
She stared 
at him. "I needed 
to get the rook out. " 
" You could have lost your king pawn. " 

1 49 

WALTER TEVIS 

She wasn't sure what he 
was talking 
about. 
She rememÂ­
bered the game well and had gone over it 
in her head a few 
times but found nothing 
wrong with it. Was it 
possible 
he 
had memorized 
the moves from Life and found a weakÂ­
ness? Or was he just showing off? Standing 
there, she 
pictured the position 
after the castle; 
the king pawn looked 
all right to her. 
"I don' t think so. " 
"He plays bishop to B-5 , and you' ve got to break the 
pin . " 
" Wait a minute, " she said. 
"I can ' t , " Benny said. "I've got to play an adjournÂ­
ment. Set it 
up and think it out. Your problem 
is his queen 
knight.' ' 
Suddenly 
she was angry. "I don' t have to set it up to 
think it out.' ' 
"Goodness! " he said and left. 
When he was gone, she stood by the Coke machine 
for 
several 
minutes 
going over the game, and then she saw 
it. 
There was an empty tournament 
board on a table near her; 
she set up the position 
before castling 
against 
Beltik, just 
to be certain , but she felt a knot in her 
stomach 
doing it. 
Beltik 
could have made the pin, and then his queen knight 
became a threat. 
She had to 
break the pin and then protect 
against 
a fork with that damned knight, 
and after that he 
had a rook threat 
and, bingo, 
there went her pawn. It 
could 
have been crucial. But what was worse, she 
hadn' t seen it. 
And Benny 
Watts, just reading 
Life magazine, reading 
about a player 
he knew nothing 
about, 
had picked it up. 
She was standing 
at the board; she bit her lip, reached 
down and toppled 
the king. She had been so proud of 
finding an error in a Morphy game when she was in 

1 50 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

seventh 
grade. 
Now she'd had something 
like that done to 
her, and she did not like it. Not at all. 
She was sitting 
behind the white pieces 
at Board One 
when Watts carne in. When he shook her hand, he said 
in 
a low voice, 
" Knight to knight 
five. Right?" 
" Yes," she said, between 
her teeth. A flash 
bulb popped. 
Beth pushed her queen
' s pawn to queen four. 
She played the Queen's Gambit against 
him and by 
rnidgarne felt with dismay that it had 
been a mistake. 
The 
Queen's Gambit could lead to complicated positions, 
and 
this one was 
Byzantine. 
There were half a dozen threats 
on 
each side, and the thing that made her nervou
s, that made 
her reach out for a piece several 
times and then stop her 
hand before touching it 
and draw back, was that she didn' t 
trust herself. 
She did not 
trust herself 
t o see everything 
Benny Watts could see. He played with a calm, pleasant 
precision, picking 
up his pieces 
lightly 
and setting 
them 
down noiselessly, 
sometimes 
smiling 
to himself 
as he did 
so. Every move he made looked solid as a rock . 
Beth's 
great strength 
was in fast attack, and she could find no 
way to attack. By the sixteenth 
move she was furious with 
herself 
for playing 
the gambit in the first place
. 
There must have been forty people 
clustered around 
the 
especially 
large wooden table. There was a brown velvet 
curtain behind 
them with 
the names 
HARMON and WATTS 
pinned to it. The horrible 
feeling, at the bottom of the 
anger and fear, was that she was the weaker player-that 
Benny Watts knew more about chess than she did 
and 
could play it better. 
It was a new feeling for her, and it 
seemed to bind and restrict 
her as she had 
not been bound 
and restricted 
since the last time she sat in Mrs. Deardorf
f's 
office. For a moment she looked over the crowd around 

1 5 1 

WALTER TEVIS 

the table, trying 
to find Mrs. Wheatley
, but she was not 
there. Beth turned back to the board and looked briefly 
at 
Benny. He smiled 
at her serenely, as though he were 
offering her a drink rather than a head-splitting 
chess 
position
. Beth set her elbows 
on the table, leaned her 
cheeks against 
her clenched 
fists and began to 
concentrate. 
After a moment a 
simple 
thought 
came to her: I ' m not 
playing 
Benny Watts; I ' m playing 
chess. 
She looked 
at 
him again. His eyes were studying 
the board now . He 
can' t move until I do. He can only 
move one piece at a 
time. She looked back to 
the board and began to consider 
the effects of trading, to picture 
where the pawns would be 
if the pieces 
that clogged 
the center 
were exchanged
. If she 
took his king knight with her 
bishop 
and he retook 
with the 
queen pawn . . . No good. She could advance 
the knight 
and force a trade. That was better. 
She blinked and began 
to relax, forming 
and reforming the relationships 
of pawns 
in her mind, searching for a way of forcing an advantage
. 
There was nothing 
in front of her now 
but the sixty-f
our 
squares 
and the shifting 
architectur
e of pawns
-a jagged 
skyline 
of imaginary pawns, black and 
white, 
that flowed 
and shifted as she tried variation 
after variation, branch 
after branch of the game tree that grew from each set of 
moves. One branch began 
to look better 
than the others. 
She followed 
it for several 
half-moves to the possibilities 
that grew from it, holding 
in her mind the whole set of 
imaginary positions until 
she found one that had what she 
wanted to find. 
She sighed 
and sat 
upright. 
When she pulled her 
face 
away from her fists, her cheeks were sore and her shoulÂ­
ders stiff. She looked at her 
clock. 
Forty minutes 
had 
passed. Watts was yawning. She reached 
out and made the 

1 52 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

move, advancing 
a knight 
in a way that would force the 
first 
trade. It 
looked innocuous 
enough. Then she punched 
the clock. 
Watts studied 
the board for half a minute and 
started 
the 
trade. For a moment she felt panic in her stomach: 
Could 
he see what 
she was planning? 
That quickly? 
She tried to 
shake off the idea and took the 
offered piece. He took 
another, 
just as she had 
planned. 
She took. Watts 
reached 
out to take again, but hesitated. 
Do it! she commanded 
silently. 
But he pulled his hand back. If he saw through 
what she was planning, 
there was stiii 
time to get out of 
it. 
She bit her 
lip. He was studying 
the board intently. He 
would see it. The ticking 
of the clock seemed very loud. 
Beth' s heart was beating 
so strongly 
that for a moment 
she 
feared Watts would 
hear it and know she was panicked 
and-
But he didn't. He took the trade just as she had planned 
it. She looked at his face almost in disbelief. 
It was too 
late for him now. He pressed 
the button 
that stopped 
his 
clock and 
started hers. 
She pushed the pawn up to rook five. Immediately 
he 
stiffened in his chair-almost impercept
ibly, but Beth 
saw 
it. He began studying 
the position 
intently. But he must 
have seen he was going to be stuck with 
doubled 
pawns; 
after two or three minutes 
he shrugged 
and made the 
necessary 
move, and Beth did her continuat
ion, and then 
on the next move the 
pawn was doubled 
and the nervousÂ­
ness and anger had left her. She was out to win now. She 
would hammer at his weakness . She loved it. She loved 
attack. 
Benny looked at her impassively 
for a moment. 
Then he 
reached 
out his hand, picked up his queen, and did some-

1 53 

WALTER TEVIS 

thing astonishing. 
He quietly 
captured 
her center 
pawn. 
Her protected 
pawn. The pawn that had been holding 
the 
queen to her comer for most of the game. He was sacrificÂ­
ing his 
queen. 
She could not believe 
it. 
And then she saw 
what it meant, and her 
stomach 
twisted 
sharply. How had she missed it? With the pawn 
gone, she was open to a rook-bishop 
mate because 
of the 
bishop on the opened diagonal
. She could 
protect 
by reÂ­
treating 
her knight 
and moving one of her 
rooks over, but 
the protection 
wouldn't last, 
because-she 
saw now with 
horror-his innocent-looking 
knight 
would block her 
king's 
escape. 
It was terrible. It was the kind of thing she 
did to 
other people. It was the 
kind of thing Paul Morphy had 
done. And she had been thinking 
about doubled 
pawns. 
She didn't have to take the queen. What would 
happen 
if she didn't? She would lose 
the pawn he had 
just taken. 
His queen would sit 
there in the center of the board. 
Worse, it could 
come over to her king rook file and press 
down on her castled 
king. The more she looked, the worse 
it became. And it had caught her completely 
off-guard. 
She put 
her elbows on the table and 
stared at the position. 
She needed a counterthreat, a move that would stop him in 
his tracks. 
There wasn't any. She spent a 
half-hour studying 
the 
board and found only 
that Benny' s move was even sounder 
than she had 
thought. 
Maybe she could trade her way out of 
it if he attacked 
too quickly. She found a rook move and made it. If he 
would just bring the queen over 
now, there would be a 
chance to trade. 
He didn't. He developed 
his other bishop. 
She brought 
the rook up to the second rank. Then he 
swung the queen 

1 54 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

over, threate
ning mate in three. She had to respond 
by 
retreat
ing her knight into the comer. He kept attacking, 
and with impotent 
dismay, 
she saw a lost game gradually 
become manifest. When he took her king bishop pawn 
with his bishop, 
sacrificing 
it, it was over, and she knew it 
was over. There was nothing 
to do. She wanted to scream, 
but instead set 
her king on its side and got up from the 
table. 
Her legs and 
back were stiff and painful. Her stomÂ­
ach was knotted. All she had really needed was a draw, 
and she hadn' t been able 
to get even that. Benny had 
drawn twice already 
in the tournament. 
She had gone into 
the game with a perfect 
score, 
and a draw would have 
given her the title. But she had 
gone for a win. 
"Tough game, " Benny was saying. He was holding 
out 
his hand. She forced hersl!lf 
to take it. 
People were 
applauding. Not applauding 
her but Benny Watts. 
By evening 
she could still 
feel it, but it 
had lessened. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
tried to console 
her. The prize money 
would be split. 
She and Benny would 
be co-champi
ons, 
each with a 
small trophy . 
" It happens 
all the time, " Mrs. 
Wheatley 
said. " I have made inquiri
es, and the Open 
Championship 
is often shared. " 
" I didn't see what 
he was doing, " Beth said, picturing 
the move where his queen took her pawn. It was like 
putting 
your tongue against 
an aching 
tooth. 
" You can't finesse 
everything, 
dear , " Mrs. Wheatley 
said. ' 'Nobody can .' ' 
Beth looked at her. " You don't know anything 
about 
chess, " she said. 
"I know what it feels like to lose." 
"I bet you 
do, " Beth said, as viciously 
as she could. " I 
just bet you do.' ' 

1 55 

WALTER TEVIS 

Mrs. Wheatley 
peered at her meditatively 
for a moment. 
" And now you do too , " she said 
softly. 

Sometimes 
Â·On the street 
that winter 
in Lexington 
people 
would look 
back over their shoulders at her. She was on 
the Morning Show on WLEX. The interviewer, 
a woman 
with heavily 
lacquered 
hair and harlequin 
glasses, 
asked 
Beth if she 
played 
bridge; 
Beth said no. Did she like being 
the U . S . Open Champion 
at chess? Beth said she 
was 
co-champion. Beth sat 
in a director's chair with bright 
lights 
shining 
on her face. She was willing 
to talk about 
chess, 
but the woman' s manner, 
her false appearance 
of 
interest, 
made it difficult. Finally 
she was asked how she 
felt about the idea that chess was a waste of 
time, and she 
looked at the woman in the other chair and said, "No 
more than basketba
ll. " But before she could go on about 
that, the show was over. She 
had been on for six minutes. 
The one-page 
article 
Townes had written 
about her apÂ­
peared in the Sunday supplement 
with one of the pictures 
he had taken at the 
window of his 
room in Las Vegas. She liked herself 
in the pict
ure, with 
her right 
hand on the white queen and 
her face looking 
clear, 
serious 
and int
elligent. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
bought five 
copies 
of the paper for her scrapbook
. 
Beth was in high school now, and there was a chess 
club, but she did not belong. 
The boys in it were nonÂ­
plused to have a Master walking 
the hallways
, and they 
would stare at 
her in a kind 
of embarrassed 
awe when she 
passed. 
Once a boy from twelfth grade stopped 
her to ask 
nervously 
if she would give a 
simultaneous 
in Chess Club 
sometime. 
She would play about thirty students 
at once. 
She remembered 
that other high school, near Methuen, 

of the Herald-Leader 

1 56 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

and the 
way she was stared 
at afterward. ' 'I'm sorry, " she 
said, "I don't have time." The boy was 
unattractive 
and 
creepy-looking; 
it made her feel unattractive 
and creepy 
just to be talking 
with him. 
She spent about an hour a night on her homework and 
made As. But homework meant nothing 
to her. It was the 
five or six hours of studying 
chess that was at the center 
of 
her life. She was enrolled 
as a special 
student 
at the 
university 
for a class in Russian 
that met one night 
a week. 
It was the only schoolwork 
that she paid serious 
attention 
to. 

1 57 

CHAPTER 7 

Beth puffed, inhaled 
and held the smoke 
in. There was 
nothing 
to it. She handed the 
joint to the young man on her 
right, 
and he said, "Thank you . " He had been 
talking 
about Donald Duck 
with Eileen. 
They were in Eileen 
and 
Barbara' s apartment, a block off Main Street. It was EiÂ­
leen who 
had invited 
Beth to the party, after the night 
class. 
"It's got 
to be Mel Blanc , " Eileen 
was saying now. 
"They' re all Mel 
B lanc ." Beth was still 
holding 
the smoke 
in, hoping that it would loosen her 
up. She had been 
sitting 
on the 
floor with these college 
students for 
half an 
hour and had said nothing. 
"Blanc does Sylvester, 
but he doe
sn't do Donald 
Duck, " 
the young man said with finality. 
He turned around to face 
Beth. "I'm Tim, " he said. " You' re the chess player." 
Beth let the smoke 
out. "That's 
right." 

1 5 8 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

" You're the U . S . Women's Champion. " 
"I'm the U . S . Open Co-Champion
, " Beth said. 
"Sorry. It must 
be a trip. " He was red-haired 
and thin. 
She had seen him sitting 
in the middle of the classroom 
and could remember 
his soft voice when they recited 
Russian 
phrases 
in unison. 
"Do you play?" Beth did not like the strain 
in her 
voice. 
She felt out 
of place. 
She should 
either 
go home or 
call Mrs. Wheatley. 
He shook his head. "Too cerebral
. You want 
a beer?" 
She hadn't had 
a beer since Las Vegas, a year before. 
" Okay, " she said
. She started 
to get up from 
the floor. 
"I'll get it. " He pushed himself 
up from where they 
were sitting 
on the carpet. He came back with two cans 
and handed her one. She took a long drink. During 
the 
first 
hour the music 
had been so loud that conversation 
was 
impossible
, but when tbe last record 
ended no one replaced 
it. The disk on the hi-f
i against 
the far wall was still 
turning, 
and she could see the little 
red lights 
on the 
amplifier. 
She hoped no 
one would notice 
and play another 
record. 
Tim eased 
himself 
back down next 
to her with a 
sigh. 
' 'I used to play Monopoly 
a lot.' ' 
"I've never played 
that. " 
" It makes you a slave of capitalism. 
I still 
dream about 
big bucks . ' ' 
Beth laughed . The joint had come back her way, and 
she held it between 
her fingertips and 
got what she could 
from it before passing 
it to Ti
m . "Why are you taking 
Russian, " she said, "if you're a slave of capital
ism?" She 
took another 
swallow 
of beer. 
" You've got nice boobs, " he said 
and took a drag.

" We need another 
joint, " he announced 
to the group at 
large. He turned back 
to Beth. "I wanted to read Dostoevsky 
in the original
. ' ' 
She finished 
her beer. Somebody produced 
another 
joint 
and began sending 
it around. There were a dozen people 
in 
the room. They'd had their first 
exam in 
the evening 
class, 
and Beth had been invited 
to the party afterward. With the 
beer and marijuana and talking 
to Tim , who seemed very 
easy to talk to, she felt better. 
When the joint came up 
again, she took a long drag on it, and then another. 
Someone 
put on a record. The music sounded 
much better, 
and the loudness 
didn't bother 
her now. 
Suddenly 
she stood up. "I ought 
to call home," she 
said. 
" In the bedroom, through 
the kitchen. " 
In the kitchen 
she opened another 
beer. She took a long 
swallow, pushed open the bedroom door and felt for a 
light switch. She could not find it. A box of wooden 
matches 
sat on the stove 
by the frying pan, and she took 
it 
into the 
bedroom. She still 
could not find a switch, but on 
the dresser 
was a collection 
of candles 
in different shapes. 
She lit one 
and shook out 
the match. She stared 
for a 
moment at the candle. 
It was a lavender 
upright wax penis 
with a pair of 
glossy 
testicles 
at its base. The wick came 
from the glans, and most of the glans had already melted 
away. Something 
in her was shocked. 
The telephone 
was on a table by the unmade bed. She 
carried 
the candle 
with her, sat on the edge of the bed, and 
dialed. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
was a bit confused 
at first; she was 
dazed from either 
TV or beer. " You go on to bed , " Beth 
said. "I've got a 
key . " 

1 60 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

"Did you say 
you were partying with college 
students?" 
Mrs . Wheatley 
said. "From the university?" 
" Yes . " 
" Well , be careful 
what you smoke, honey. " 
There was a marvelous 
feeling across 
Beth ' s shoulders 
and on the back of her neck. For a moment she wanted to 
rush home and embrace 
Mrs. Wheatley 
and hold her 
tight. 
But all she said was, "Okay . " 
"See you in the morning, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said. 
Beth sat on the edge of the bed, listening 
to the music 
from the living 
room, and finished her beer. She hardly 
ever listened to music and had never been to a school 
dance. 
If you didn't count the Apple Pi' s , this was the first 
party she had ever been to. In the living 
room the song 
ended. A moment later, 
Tim sat on the bed 
beside 
her. It 
seemed perfectly natural, like the response 
to a request 
she 
had made. "Have another bee
r," he said. 
She took it and drank. Her movements 
felt slow and 
certain. "Jesus! " Tim whispered in mock alarm. 
" What's 
that purple 
thing burning there?" 
" You tell me, " Beth said. 

She panicked 
for a moment as he pushed himself 
into her. 
It seemed frighteningly 
big, and she felt helpless, as if she 
were in a dentist's 
chair. 
But that 
didn't last. He was 
careful, and it didn' t hurt badly. She put her arms 
around 
his back, 
feeling the roughness 
of his bulky sweater. 
He 
began moving. 
He began to 
squeeze 
her breasts 
under her 
blouse. 
"Don' t do that , " she said, and he said, "WhatÂ­
ever you say , ' ' and kept moving in and out. She could 
barely 
feel his penis now, but it was all right. 
She was 
seventeen, and it was about time. He was wearing 
a 

1 6 1 

WALTER TEVIS 

condom. 
The best 
part had been watching 
him put it on, 
joking 
about it. What they were doing was really 
all right 
and nothing 
like books or movies
. Fucking. 
Wel l , now. If 
only he were 
Townes. 
Afterward 
she fell asleep 
on the bed. Not in a lovers' 
embrace, not even touching 
the man she had 
just made 
love with, 
but sprawled 
out on the bed with her clothes 
on. 
She saw 
Tim blow out the candle 
and heard the 
door close 
quietly 
after him. 
When she awoke, she saw by the electric 
alarm clock 
that it was nearly ten in the morning. Sunlight 
came 
around the edges of the bedroom window blinds. The air 
smelled 
stale. Her legs were prickly 
from her wool skirt, 
and the neck of her sweater had 
been pressed 
against 
her 
throat, 
which felt sweaty. 
She was ferociously 
hungry. She 
sat on the edge of the bed a minute, 
blinking. 
She got 
up 
and pushed open the 
kitchen 
door. Empty bottles and 
beer 
cans were everywhere
. The air was 
foul with dead smoke. 
A note was fastened 
to the refrigerator 
door with 
a magnet 
in the shape of Mickey Mouse's head. It read: "Everybody 
went to Cincinnati 
to see a movie. Stay as long as you 
like . ' ' 
The bathroom 
was off the living 
room. When she had 
finished 
showering and 
had dried herself, 
she wrapped 
a 
towel around her hair, 
went back to the kitchen and 
opened 
the refrigerator. 
There were eggs in a carton, two cans of 
Budweiser and some 
pickles. On the door shelf was a 
Baggie. She picked 
it up. Inside 
was a single, 
tightly 
rolled 
joint. She took it out, put it in her mouth and lit it 
with a wooden match. She inhaled 
deeply. 
Then she took 
out four eggs and put them on to boil. She had never felt 
so hungry in her life. She cleaned 
up the 
apartment 
in an 

1 62 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

organized 
way, as if she were playing 
chess, getting 
four 
large grocery 
bags to put all 
the bottles 
and butts in and 
stacking 
these on the back porch. She found a half-full 
bottle 
of Ripple 
and four unopened 
beer cans in the 
debris. 
She opened a beer and began vacuuming 
the living-room 
carpet. 
Hanging 
over a chair in the bedroom was a pair of 
jeans. When she had finished cleaning 
she changed 
into 
them. They fit her 
perfectly. She found a white T-shirt 
in a 
drawer and put it 
on. Then she drank the rest of her beer 
and opened another. 
Someone had left a lipstick on 
the 
back of the toilet. 
She went 
to the bathroom 
and studying 
herself 
in the mirror, reddened 
her lips carefully. She had 
never worn lipstick 
before. She was beginning 
to feel very 
good. 

called.' ' 

Mrs . Wheatley
's voice sounded 
faint and anxious. " You 
might have 
' 'I'm sorry, " Beth said. " I didn' t want to wake you 
up. ' ' 
" I wouldn' t have minded . . . " 
"Anyway, I ' m all right. 
And I'm going to Cincinnati 
to 
see a movie. I won't be horne tonight 
either. " 
There was a silence 
at the other end of the line. 
"I'll be back 
after school 
Monday." 
Finally, Mrs. Wheatley 
spoke. " Are you with a 
boy?" 
"I was last night." 
"Oh . " Mrs. Wheatley
's voice sounded 
distant. "Beth . . . " 
Beth laughed. 
"Corne on, " she said. "I'm all right. " 
"Well . . . " She still 
sounded 
grave, then her voice 
became lighter. 
"I suppose 
it's all right. 
It's just that-" 
Beth smiled. 
"I won't get pregnant," she said. 

1 63 

WALTER TEVIS 

At noon she put the rest of the eggs in a pot to boil and 
turned on the hi-fi. 
She had never 
really listened 
to music 
before, but she listened 
now. She danced a few steps in the 
middle 
of the living 
room, waiting 
for the eggs. She would 
not let 
herself 
get sick. She would eat frequently 
and drink 
one beer--or one glass 
of wine-every hour. She had 
made love 
the night before, and now it 
was time to learn 
about being drunk. 
She was 
alone, 
and she liked it. It was 
the way she had learned everything 
important 
in her life. 
At four in the afternoon she walked into Larry's PackÂ­
age Store, 
a block from the apartment, 
and bought a fifth 
of Ripple. 
When the man was putting 
it in the bag, she 
said, " Do you have a wine like Ripple that's not so 
sweet?" 
"These soda-pop 
wines are all the same , " the man said. 
" What about burgundy?" Sometimes 
Mrs. Wheatley 
ordered 
burgundy 
with her dinner when 
they ate out. 
"I've got Gallo, 
Italian 
Swiss Colony, 
Paul Masson . . . " 
"Paul Masson, " Beth said. "Two bottles. " 
That night at eleven 
she was able to get undressed 
by 
being careful. She had found a pair of pajamas earlier 
and 
she managed to get them on and to pile her clothes 
on a 
chair before 
getting 
into bed and 
passing 
out. 
No one had come 
back by 
morning. 
She made scramÂ­
bled eggs and ate them with two pieces of toast before 
having 
her first glass of wine. It was another 
sunny day. In 
the living 
room she found Vivaldi
's "The 
Four Seasons. " 
She put it on. Then she began drinking 
in earnest. 

On Monday morning Beth took a 
taxi to Henry Clay High 
School and arrived 
ten minutes 
before her first class. She 
had left the apartment 
empty and clean; 
the owners had not 

1 64 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

yet returned 
from Cincinnati. Most of the wrinkles 
had 
hung out of her sweater 
and skirt, 
and she had washed her 
argyle 
socks. 
She had drunk the second 
bottle 
of burgundy 
Sunday night and slept soundly 
for ten hours. 
Now, in the 
taxi, there was a dim ache at the back of her head and her 
hands trembled 
slightly, but outside 
the window the May 
morning was exquisite, 
and the green of 
the young leaves 
on trees was delicate and fresh. By the time 
she paid and 
got out she felt light and springy, ready to go ahead and 
finish 
high school 
and devote 
her energy to chess. She had 
three thousand 
dollars in her savings 
account; 
she was no 
longer 
a virgin; 
and she knew how to drink. 
There was an embarrassed silence 
when she came home 
after school. Mrs. Wheatley, wearing 
ï¿½ blue housedress, 
was mopping 
the kitchen 
floor. Beth 
settled 
herself 
on the 
sofa and picked 
up Reuben Fine's book on the endgame. 
It 
was a book she hat
ed. She had seen a can of Pabst on the 
side of 
the sink, but 
she did not want any. It would be 
better 
not to drink anything 
for a long while. She had had 
enough. 
When Mrs. Wheatley 
finished, 
she set the mop against 
the refrigerator 
and came into the living 
room. "I see 
you' re back, " she began. Her voice was carefully neutral. 
Beth looked at her. 
' ' I had a good 
time , ' ' she said. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
seemed uncertain 
what attitude 
to take. 
Finally 
she allowed 
herself a 
small smile. It was surprisÂ­
ingly shy, like a girl ' s smile. " Wel l , " she said, "chess 
isn't the only thing in life . " 

Beth graduated from 
high school 
in June, and Mrs. Wheatley 
gave her 
a Bulova watch. The back of the case read "With 
love from Mother.' ' She liked that, but 
what she liked 

1 65 

WALTER TEVIS 

better was 
the rating 
that came 
in the mail: 2243. At the 
school 
party, several 
other graduates 
offered 
Beth surreptiÂ­
tious drinks, but she refused. She had fruit punch and went 
home early. She needed 
to study; 
she would be playing 
her 
first international 
tournament, in 
Mexico City, in two weeks, 
and after that came the United States 
Championship
. She 
had been invited 
to the Remy-Vall on 
in Paris, at the end of 
the summer. 
Things were 
beginning 
to happen. 

1 66 

CHAPTER 8 

An hour after 
the plane crossed 
the border, Beth 
was 
absorbed 
in pawn-structur
e analysis 
am} Mrs. Wheatley 
was drinking 
her third bottle 
of Cerveza 
Corona. 
" Beth , " 
Mrs . Wheatley 
said, "I have a confession 
to make." 
Beth put the book down
, reluctantl
y . 
Mrs. Wheatley 
seemed nervous. "Do you know what a 
pen pal 
is, dear?" 
"Someone you trade letters 
with . " 
"Exactly! When I was in high school, our Spanish 
class 
was given a list of boys in Mexico 
who were studying 
English. I picked 
one and sent him a letter 
about myself.' ' 
Mrs. Wheatley 
gave a little laugh. 
"His name was Manuel. 
We corresponded 
for a long 
time--even while I was marÂ­
ried to Allston. 
We exchanged 
photograp
hs. " Mrs. Wheatley 
opened her purse, rummaged 
through 
it and produced 
a 
bent snapshot 
which she handed to Beth. It was a picture 

1 67 

WALTER TEVIS 

of a thin-faced man, surprisingly 
pale-looking, 
with a 
pencil-thin 
mustache
. Mrs . 
Wheatley 
hesitated 
and said, 
' 'Manuel will be meeting 
us at the airport.' ' 
Beth had no objection 
to this; it might even 
be a good 
thing to have a Mexican 
friend. But she was put off by 
Mrs. Wheatley
' s manner. 
"Have you met him before?" 
"Never." She leaned over in her seat and squeezed 
Beth ' s forearm. " You know, I'm really 
quite thrilled. " 
Beth could see that she was a little 
drunk. ' ' Is that why 
you wanted to come down early? ' ' 
Mrs. Wheatley 
pulled 
back and straightened 
the sleeves 
of her blue cardigan. 
"I suppose 
so, " she said. 

"Si como no? " Mrs. Wheatley 
said. " And he dresses 
so 
well, and opens doors for me and orders dinner 
beautiÂ­
fully . " She was 
pulling 
up her pantyhose 
as she 
talked, 
tugging 
fiercely to get them over her broad hips. 
They were probably 
fucking-Mrs. Wheatley 
and ManÂ­
uel Cordoba 
y Serano. Beth 
did not 
let herself 
visualiz
e it. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
had come back to 
the hotel at about three 
that morning, and at two-thir
ty the night before. Beth, 
pretending 
to be asleep, 
had smelled the ripe 
mix of 
perfume and gin while Mrs . Wheatley 
fumbled around the 
room, undressing 
and sighing. 
"I thought 
at first it was the altitude
, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said. "Seven thousand three 
hundred 
and fifty feet. " SitÂ­
ting down at the little 
brass vanity 
bench, she leaned 
forward on one elbow and began rouging 
her cheeks. " It 
makes a person positively 
giddy. But I think 
now it's the 
culture." She stopped 
and turned to Beth. "There is no 
hint of a Protestant 
ethic in Mexico. 
They are all Latin 
Catholics, and they all live 
in the here and now. " Mrs . 

1 68 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

Wheatley 
had been reading 
Alan Watts. "I think I'll have 
just one margarita 
before I go out. Would you call for one, 
honey?'' 
Back in Lexington, Mrs . 
Wheatley
' s voice would someÂ­
times have a distance 
to it, as though she were speaking 
from some lonely 
reach of an interior 
childhood. 
Here in 
Mexico City the voice was distant but 
the tone was theatriÂ­
cally gay, as though Alma Wheatley 
were savoring 
an 
incommunicable 
private 
mirth. 
It made Beth uneasy. 
For a 
moment she wanted to say 
something 
about the expensiveÂ­
ness of room service
, even measured in pesos, 
but she 
didn't. She picked up the phone and dialed 
six. The man 
answered 
in English. She told him to send a margarita 
and 
a large Coke to 7 1 3 . 
" You could come to the Folkl6rico
, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said, "I understand 
the costumes 
alone are worth 
the price 
of admission
. ' ' 
' 'The tournament 
starts 
tomorrow. I need to work on 
endgames. ' ' 
Mrs. Wheatley 
was sitting 
on the edge of the bed, 
admiring 
her feet . " Beth, honey, " she said dreamily
, 
" perhaps you need to work on yourself. Chess certainly 
isn't all there is. " 
"It's what I know. " 
Mrs. Wheatley 
gave a long sigh. " My experience 
has 
taught 
me that what you know isn't always important. " 
" What is important?" 
" Living and growing, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said with finalÂ­
ity. "Living your life . " 
With a sleazy Mexican 
salesman? 
Beth wanted to say. 
B ut she kept silent. 
She did not 
like the jealousy 
she felt. 
" Beth , " Mrs. Wheatley 
went on in a voice rich with 

1 69 

WALTER TEVIS 

plausibility. 
"You haven't visited 
Bellas 
Artes or even 
Chapultepec Park. The zoo there is delightf
ul. You ' ve 
taken your meals 
in this room and spent your time 
with 
your nose in chess books. Shouldn't you just relax on the 
day before 
the tournament 
and think about something 
other 
than chess?'' 
Beth wanted to hit her. If 
she had gone to those places, 
she would have had to go with Manuel and listen to his 
endless 
stories. 
He was forever touching 
Mrs. Wheatley
' s 
shoulder 
o r her back, standing 
too close to her, smiling 
too 
eagerly. " Mother, " she said, "tomorrow at ten 
I play the 
black pieces against 
Octavio 
Marenco, the champion 
of 
Brazil. 
That means he has the 
first move. He is thirty-f
our 
years old and an International 
Grandmaster. 
If I lose, we 
will be paying 
for this trip--this 
adventur
e--out of capital
. 
If I win, I will be playing 
someone the next day who is 
even better 
than Marenco. I need 
to work on my endgames. " 
"Honey, you are what i s called 
an 'intuitive' 
player, 
aren' t you?" Mrs. Wheatley 
had never discussed 
chess 
playing 
with her before. 
'.'I've been called 
that. Moves come 
to me sometimes
. " 
' ' I' ve noticed 
the moves they applaud 
the loudest 
are the 
ones you make quickly. And there' s a certain 
look on your 
face. ' ' 
Beth was startled. " I suppose 
you're right, " she said. 
"Intuition 
doesn't come from books. I think it' s because 
you don' t like Manuel. " 
"Manuel's all right, " Beth said, "but he doesn't come 
by to see 
"That's irrelevant," Mrs. Wheatley 
said. " You need to 
relax. There's not another 
player 
in the world as gifted as 
you are. I haven' t the remotest idea what 
faculties 
a person 

me." 

1 70 

THE QUEEN'S

uses in order to play chess well, but I am convinced 
that 
relaxation 
can only improve 
them.' ' 
Beth said nothing. She had been furious for several 
days. She did not like Mexico City or this enormous 
concrete hotel with 
its cracked 
tiles 
and leaky faucets. She 
did not like 
the food in the hotel, but she 
did not want 
to 
eat alone in restauran
ts . Mrs. Wheatley 
had gone out for 
lunch and dinner 
every day with Manuel, who owned a 
green Dodge and seemed to be always at her disposal
. 
"Why don't you have lunch with us?" Mrs. Wheatley 
said. "We can drop you off afterward 
and you can study 
then .' ' 
Beth started 
to answer, 
when there was a knock at the 
door. It 
was room service 
with Mrs. Wheatley' s margarita. 
Beth signed 
for it while Mrs . Wheatley 
took a few thoughtÂ­
ful sips and stared out the window at the sunlight. 
" I 
really 
haven't been well lately, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said, 
squinti
ng. 
Beth looked at her coolly. Mrs. Wheatley 
was pale and 
clearly overweight. 
She held the glass by the stem in one 
hand while her other hand fluttered 
at her thick waist. 
There was something 
deeply pathetic 
about her, and Beth ' s 
heart softened. 
" I don't want lunch, " Beth said, "but you 
can drop me off at the 
zoo . I ' ll take a cab back. " 
Mrs . Wheatley 
hardly seemed to hear, but after a moÂ­
ment she turned to Beth, still 
holding the 
glass in 
the same 
way, and smiled vaguely. "That'll be nice, dear," she 
said. 

Beth spent a long time looking 
at the Galapagos turtlesÂ­
big, lumbering 
creatures 
in permanent 
slow motion. One 
of the keepers 
had dumped a bushel 
of wet-looking 
lettuce 

1 7 1 

WALTER TEVIS 

Â· 

"Cerveza Corona, por 

and overripe 
tomatoes 
into their pen and 
the five 
of them 
pushed through 
the pile as a group, munching 
and tramÂ­
pling, their feet like the dusty feet of elephants 
and their 
stupid 
innocent 
faces intent 
on something 
beyond vision 
or 
food. 
While she was standing 
by the fence a vendor 
came by 
with a cart of iced beer and , hardly thinking
, she said, 
favor," and held out a 
five-peso 
note. The man flipped off 
the bottle 
top and 
poured the 
drink into a paper cup with an Aztec Eagle logo. ' 'Muchisimas 
gracias, " she said. It was her first beer 
since high school; 
in the hot Mexican 
sun, it tasted 
wonderful. She drank it 
quickly. A few minutes 
later she 
saw another 
vendor 
standing 
by a circle 
of red flowers; 
she bought another 
beer. Sbe 
knew she should 
not be 
doing this; 
the tournaÂ­
ment started 
tomorrow. She did not 
need liquor. 
Nor 
tranquilizers. She had not 
had a green pill for several 
months now. But she drank the beer. It was three in the 
afternoon, and the sun was 
ferocious. 
The zoo was full of 
women, most of them in dark rebozos , with small darkÂ­
eyed children. 
What few men there were gave Beth signifiÂ­
cant looks, but she ignored 
them, and none 
of them tried 
to speak to her. Despite 
the Mexican 
reputation 
for gaiety 
and abandon, 
it was a quiet place, 
and the crowd seemed 
more like the crowd at a museum. There were flowers 
everywhere
. 
She finished 
her beer, bought another and 
continued 
walking. 
She was beginning 
to feel high
. She passed 
more 
trees, more flowers, cages with sleeping 
chimpanze
es. 
Around a comer 
she came face to 
face with a 
family of 
gorillas. Inside 
the cage the huge male and the baby were 
asleep 
head to head with their black bodies 
pressed 
against 

1 72 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

the bars in front. In the middle of the cage the 
female 
leaned 
philosophically 
against an enormous 
truck tire, scowlÂ­
ing and 
biting 
a fingertip . Standing 
on the asphalt 
outside 
the cage was a human family, also a mother, father 
and 
child, watching 
the gorillas 
attentively. They were not 
Mexicans. It was the man who caught Beth ' s attention. 
She recogniz
ed his face. 
He was a short, 
heavy man, not unlike a gorilla himself, 
with jutting 
brow ridges, bushy eyebrows, coarse black 
hair and an impassive look. 
Beth stif
fened, holding 
her 
paper cup of beer. She felt her cheeks flushing. The man 
was Vasily 
Borgov, Chess Champion 
of the World. There 
was no mistaking the grim Russian 
face, the authoritarian 
scowl. She had seen it 
on the cover of 
several 
times, once with 
the same black suit and splashy 
green-and-gold 
tie. 
Beth stared 
for a full minute. 
She had not known Borgov 
would be at this tournament. 
She had already 
received 
her 
board assignment 
by mail: it was Board Nine. Borgov 
would be Board One. She felt a sudden chill 
at the back of 
her neck and looked down at the beer in her hand. She 
raised 
it to her 
mouth and finished it, 
resolving 
it would be 
her last until after the tournament. 
Looking 
at the Russian 
again, 
she panicked; 
would he recognize 
her? He must 
not 
see her 
drinking. 
He was looking 
into the cage as though 
waiting 
for the 
gorilla to move a pawn. The gorilla 
was 
clearly 
lost in her own thoughts, ignoring 
everyone. Beth 
envied 
her. 
Beth had no more beer that day and went to bed early, 
but she was awakened 
by Mrs. Wheatley
's arrival, someÂ­
time in the middle of the night. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
coughed 
a 

Chess Review 

1 7 3 

WALTER TEVIS 

good deal while she was undressing 
in the darkened 
room. 
"Go ahead and 
tum the light on," Beth said. "I'm awake. " 
' 'I'm sorry , " Mrs. Wheatley 
gasped between coug
hs. 
" I seem to have a virus. " She turned 
the bathroom 
light 
on and partially 
closed 
the door. Beth looked at the little 
Japanese 
clock on the nightstand. 
It was ten after four. The 
sounds she made undressing
-the rustling 
and partly 
supÂ­
pressed 
coughing
-were infuriating. Beth's first 
chess game 
would begin in six hours. She lay in bed furious and tense
, 
waiting 
for Mrs . Wheatley 
to be quiet. 

Marenco was a somber little 
dark-skinned 
man in a dazÂ­
zling canary-col
ored shirt. 
He spoke almost 
no English 
and 
Beth no Portuguese, 
they began playing 
without 
prelimiÂ­
nary conversa
tion. Beth did not feel like talking, 
anyway. 
Her eyes were scratchy , and her body was uncomfortable 
all over. She had felt generally 
unpleasant 
from the time 
their plane landed in Mexico, 
as though she were on the 
verge of developing 
an illness 
that she never quite got, and 
she had not gone back to 
sleep the night 
before. Mrs . 
Wheatley 
had coughed in her sleep 
and muttered and 
rasped, 
while Beth tried to force herself 
to relax, to ignore 
the distractions. She did not have any green pills 
with her. 
There were three left, 
but they were in Kentucky
. She lay 
on her back with her arms straight 
at her sides as she had 
as an eight-year-old 
trying 
to sleep by the hallway 
door at 
Methuen. Now, sitting 
on a straight 
wooden chair in front 
of a long tableful of chessboards 
in the ballroom 
of a 
Mexican 
hotel, she felt irritated 
and a bit dizzy. Marenco 
had just opened with pawn to king four. Her clock was 
ticking
. She shrugged 
and played pawn to queen's bishop 
four, trusting 
the formal maneuvers 
of the Sicilian 
to keep 

1 74 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

her steady 
until she got into the game
. Marenco brought 
the king' 
s knight out 
with civil 
orthodoxy. She pushed the 
queen pawn to the fourth rank; he 
exchanged 
pawns. She 
began to relax as her 
mind moved away from her body and 
onto the tableau 
of forces in front of her. 
By eleven-thirty 
she had 
him down by two pawns, and 
just after noon he resigned. They had 
got nowhere 
close to 
an endgame; when Marenco 
stood up and offered her his 
hand, the 
board was still 
massed with uncaptured 
pieces. 
The top three boards were in a separate 
room across the 
hallway from 
the main ballroom . 
Beth had glanced 
at it 
that morning 
while rushing, five minutes 
late, to the 
place 
where she was to play, but she had not stopped 
to look in. 
She walked toward it now, across 
the carpeted 
room with 
its rows of players bent over 
boards-players 
from the 
Philippines 
and West Germany and Iceland 
and Norway 
and Chile, 
most of them young, almost all of them male. 
There were two other 
women: a Mexican 
official' s niece, 
at Board Twenty-t
wo, and an intense 
young housewife 
from Buenos Aires; 
she was at Board Seventeen. 
Beth did 
not stop to 
look at any 
of the positions
. 
Several people 
were standing 
in the hallway 
outside 
the 
smaller 
game room. She pushed past them into 
the doorÂ­
way, and there across 
the room from her at Board One, 
wearing 
the same dark suit, the same grim 
scowl, was 
Vasily Borgov, his expressionless 
eyes on the game in 
front of him. A respectf
ully silent 
crowd stood 
between 
her and him, but the players 
sat on a kind of wooden stage 
a few feet above floor 
level, and she could see him 
clearly
. 
Behind him on the wall was a 
display chessboard with 
cardboard 
pieces; 
a Mexican 
was just moving 
one of the 

1 75 

WALTER TEVIS 

white knights 
into its new position 
as Beth came in. She 
studied 
the board for a moment. Everything 
was very 
tight, 
but Borgov seemed to have an edge. 
She looked at Borgov and quickly 
looked away. His 
face was alarming in its concentration. She turned and left, 
walking 
slowly 
along the hall. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
was in bed but awake. She blinked 
at 
Beth from the bed, pulling 
the covers 
up to her chin. "Hi, 
sweetie. " 
" I thought 
we could have lunch, " Beth said. " I don' t 
play again until tomorrow. ' ' 
"Lunch, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said. " Oh my. " And then: 
"How did you do?" 
' 'He resigned 
after thirty 
moves. ' ' 
" You' re a wonder , " Mrs. Wheatley 
said. She 
pushed 
herself 
carefully up in bed until she was sitting. 
"I'm 
feeling wonky, but I probably 
need something 
in my stomÂ­
ach. Manuel and I had cabrito 
for dinner. 
It may yet be the 
end of me. " She looked very pale. She got out of bed 
slowly and 
walked to the bathroom. ' 'I suppose 
I could 
have a sandwich, or one of those less inflamed 
tacos. " 

The competition 
at the tournament 
was more consistent, 
vigorous 
and professional 
than anything 
Beth had seen 
before, yet its 
effect on her, once she had 
got through 
the 
first game after a near-sleepless night, 
was not disturbing. 
It was a smoothly run 
affair, with all announcements 
made 
in both Spanish 
and English. Everything 
was hushed. In 
her game the 
next day she 
played the 
Queen' s Gambit 
Declined 
against 
an Austrian 
named Diedrich
, a pale, 
esthetic 
young man in a sleeveless 
sweater, 
and she forced 

1 76 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

him to resign 
in midgame with a relentless pressure 
in the 
center 
of the board. 
She did it mostly 
with pawns and was 
herself 
quietly 
amazed at the intricacies that seemed 
to 
flow from her fingertips 
as she took 
the center 
of the board 
and began 
to crush his position 
as one might crush 
an egg. 
He had played 
well, made no blunders 
or anything 
that 
could properly 
be called 
a mistake, 
but Beth moved with 
such deadly accuracy, such measured 
control, that his 
position 
was hopeless 
by the 
twenty-third 
move. 

Mrs . Wheatley 
had invited 
her to have dinner 
with her and 
Manuel; 
Beth had refused. Although 
you didn't eat dinner 
in Mexico until ten o'clock, she did not expect to 
find 
Mrs. Wheatley 
in the room when she came back from 
shopping 
at seven. 
She was dressed 
but in bed with her head propped 
up 
against 
a pillow. 
A half-finished 
drink sat on the nightÂ­
stand beside 
her. Mrs . Wheatley 
was in her mid-forties, 
but the paleness 
of her face and the lines of worry in her 
forehead made her look much 
older. 
"Hello, dear," she 
said in a faint voice. 
"Are you sick?" 
"A bit under the 
weather. " 
"I could 
get a doctor." 
The word "doctor" seemed to hang in the air between 
them until Mrs. Wheatley 
said, "It's not that 
bad. I just 
need rest.' ' 
Beth nodded and went into the bathroom 
to wash up. 
Mrs . Wheatley's appearance 
and behavior 
were disturbing. 
But when Beth 
came back into the 
room, she was out of 
bed and looking 
lively 
enough, 
smoothing 
the covers. She 
smiled 
wryly. "Manuel won't be coming. " 

1 77 

WALTER TEVIS 

Beth looked 
inquiringly 
at her. 
"He had business 
in Oaxaca. " 
Beth hesitated 
for a moment. "How long 
will he be 
away?'' 
Mrs. Wheatley 
sighed. " At least 
until we leave. " 
"I'm sorry . " 
" Well, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said, " I ' ve never 
been to OaÂ­
xaca, but I suspect it resembles 
Denver. " 
Beth stared at 
her a moment and then laughed. " We can 
have dinner 
together
, " she said. 
" You can take 
me to one 
of the places 
you know about.' ' 
"Of course, " Mrs . Wheatley 
said. She 
smiled 
ruefully. 
" It was fun while it lasted. 
He really 
had a pleasant 
sense 
of humor
. " 
"That's 
good, " Beth said. "Mr. Wheatley 
didn' t seem 
very amusing. ' ' 
"My God, " Mrs. Wheatley 
said, "Allston never thought 
anything was 
funny, except maybe Eleanor 
Roosevelt.
' ' 

I n this tournament 
each player played 
one game a day. It 
would go on for six days. Beth's first two games were 
simple 
enough for her, 
but the third came as a shock. 
She arrived five minutes 
early and was 
at the board 
when her opponent 
came walking 
up, a bit awkwardly. He 
looked about twelve years old. Beth had seen him around 
the ballroom, 
had passed 
boards where he was playing, 
but 
she had been distracted
, and his youth hadn't really regisÂ­
tered. He had curly black 
hair and wore an old-fashioned 
white sport 
shirt, 
so neatly 
ironed 
that its creases 
stood out 
from his thin arms. It was very strange, and she felt 
uncomfortable. She was supposed 
to be the pr
odigy. 
He 
looked so damned serious. 

1 7 8 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

She held out her hand. "I'm Beth Harmon. " 
He stood, bowed slightly, 
took her hand firmly and 
shook it once. 
"I am Georgi Petrovitch 
Girev, " he said. 
Then he 
smiled shyly, a small furtive smile. "I am 
honored. " 
She felt fluster
ed. "Thanks. " They both sat, and he 
pressed 
the button down 
on her 
clock. She played 
pawn to 
queen four, glad to 
have the first 
move against 
this unnervÂ­
ing child. 
It started 
out as a routine 
Queen' s Gambit Accepted
; he 
took the offered 
bishop pawn, and they both developed 
toward the center. 
But as they got into the midgame it 
became more complex than usual
, and she realized 
that he 
was playing 
a very sophistic
ated defense. He moved fastÂ­
maddeningly 
fast-and 
he seemed to 
know exactly 
what 
he was going to do. She tried a few threats
, but he was 
unperturbed 
by them. An hour passed, 
then another. The 
move numbers were now in the thirties, and the board was 
dense with men. She looked 
at him as he was moving a 
piece-at the skinny little 
arm stuck out from the absurd 
shirt-and 
she hated him. He could have been a machine. 
You little 
creep, 
she thought, 
suddenly 
realizing 
that the 
adults 
she had played as a child must have thought 
the 
same thing about her. 
It was afternoon 
now, and most of 
the games 
were 
finished. 
They were on move thirty-f
our. She wanted to 
get this over with and get back to Mrs. Wheatley. She was 
worried 
about Mrs . Wheatley. She felt old 
and weary 
playing 
this tireless 
child with his 
bright 
dark eyes and 
quick little 
movements; she knew 
that if she made even a 
small blunder, 
he would 
be at her throat. 
She looked 
at her 
clock. 
Twenty-f
ive minutes 
left. She would have to speed 

1 79 

WALTER TEVIS 

up and get forty moves in before her flag dropped. If she 
didn' t watch it, 
he would have her 
in serious 
time presÂ­
sure. That was something 
she was in the habit of putting 
other people in; it made her 
uneasy. She had never been 
behind on the clock before. 
For the 
last several 
moves she had 
been considering 
a 
series 
of trades 
in the center-knight 
and bishop 
for knight 
and bishop, 
and a rook exchange 
a few moves later. 
It 
would simplif
y a good deal, but the problem 
was that it 
made for an endgame and she tried to avoid endgames. 
Now, seeing 
that she was forty-five 
minutes 
behind 
him on 
the clock, 
she felt uncomfortable. She would have to get 
rid of 
this log jam. She picked 
up her knight 
and took his 
king's bishop 
with it. He responded 
immediat
ely, not even 
looking 
up at her. He took her queen's bishop. They 
continued 
with the moves 
as though they had 
been predeÂ­
termined, and when it 
was over, the board was full of 
empty spaces. 
Each player had a rook, a knight, four 
pawns 
and the king. She brought 
her king out from the back rank, 
and so did he. At this stage the 
king's power as an attacker 
became abruptly 
manifest; 
it was no longer 
necessary to 
hide it. The question 
now was one 
of getting 
a pawn to the 
eighth 
rank and promoting 
it. They were in the endgame. 
She drew in her breath, shook 
her head to clear it and 
began to concentrate on the position. 
The important 
thing 
was to have a plan. 
" We should perhaps ad
journ now. " It was Girev's 
voice, 
almost 
a whisper. 
She looked at his face, pale and 
serious, and then looked back at the clock. 
Both flags had 
fallen. That had never happened 
to her before. She was 
startled 
and sat stupidly 
in her chair for a moment. 
" You 
must seal the move , " Girev said. Suddenly 
he looked 

1 80 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

Â· 

uncomfortable 
and held up his 
hand for the tournament 
director. 
One of the directors 
came over, walking 
softly. It was a 
middle-aged 
man with 
thick glasses
. "Miss Harmon must 
seal her 
move , " Girev said. 
The director looked 
at the clock. 
"I'll get an envelope
. " 
She looked at the 
board again. It seemed clear enough. 
She should 
advance 
the rook pawn that 
she had decided 
on 
already, putting it 
on the fourth rank. The director 
handed 
her an envelope 
and stepped 
discreetly 
back a few steps. 
Girev rose and turned away politely. Beth wrote "P-QR4" 
on her score sheet, 
folded it, put it in the envelope 
and 
handed it to 
the tournament 
director. 
She stood 
up stiffly and looked around her. There were 
no more games in progress, although 
a few players were 
still 
there, some seated 
and some standin
g, looking over 
positions 
on the boards. A few were huddled 
over boards , 
analyzing 
games that had 
ended. 
Girev had come back to the 
table. His face was very 
serious. "May I ask something?" he said
. 
" Yes." 
" In America, " he said, " I am told that one sees films 
in cars. Is this true?' ' 
"Drive-ins?" 
she said. " You mean drive-in 
movies?" 
" Yes. Elvis Presley 
movies that you watch from inside 
a car. Debbie Reynolds 
and Elizabeth Taylor. 
That 
happens?" 
" It sure does. " 
He looked at her, and suddenly 
his earnest face broke 
into a broad smile. "I would dig that," 
he said. " I would 
certainly dig that. 
' '

Mrs. Wheatley 
slept soundly through 
the night and was 
still sleeping 
when Beth got up. Beth felt refreshed and 
alert; 
she had gone to sleep worried 
about the adjourned 
game with Girev, but she felt all 
right about it in the 
morning. The pawn move 
had been 
strong 
enough. 
She 
walked barefoot 
from the sofa where 
she had been sleeping 
to the bed 
where Mrs
. Wheatley 
lay and felt her forehead. 
It was cool. Beth kissed 
her lightly 
on the cheek 
and went 
into the bathroom 
and showered. When she left for breakÂ­
fast, Mrs. Wheatley 
was still 
asleep . 
Her morning game was with a Mexican in his 
early 
twenties. Beth had the black 
pieces, played the Sicilian 
and caught him off-guard on the nineteenth 
move. Then 
she began wearing him 
down. Her head was very clear, 
and she was able to keep him so busy 
trying 
to answer her 
threats 
that she was able 
eventually 
to pick off a bishop 
in 
exchange 
for two pawns and drive his king into 
an exposed 
position 
with a knight check. 
When she 
brought 
her queen 
out, the Mexican 
stood up, smiled 
at her coldly and 
said, 
" Enough. Enough. " He shook his head angrily. "I resign 
the game . ' ' 
For a moment she was furious, wanting 
to finish, to 
drive his king across 
the board and checkmate 
it. " You 
play a game that is . . . awesome, " the Mexican said. 
" You make a man feel helpless
. " He bowed slightly, 
turned and left the table. 

Playing 
out the Girev game 
that afternoon, she found 
herself 
moving with astonishing 
speed and force. Girev 
was wearing 
a light-blue 
shirt this time
, and it stuck out 
from his elbows like the edges of a child's kite. She sat at 

1 82 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

the board impatiently 
while the tournament 
director 
opened 
the envelope and made the 
pawn move she had sealed the 
day before. She got up and paced across the 
nearly 
empty 
ballroom 
where two other adjournments 
were being played 
out, waiting 
for Girev to move. She looked 
back across the 
room toward him several 
times and saw 
him hunched over 
the board, his little 
fists 
jammed into 
his pale cheeks, the 
blue shirt seeming 
to glow under the lights. 
She hated 
him-hated 
his seriousness 
and hated his youth. 
She wanted 
to crush him. 
She could 
hear the click 
of the clock 
button 
from halfÂ­
way across 
the room and made a beeline 
back to the table. 
She did not take her seat but stood looking 
at the position
. 
He had put his rook on the queen bishop file, as she had 
thought 
he might. 
She was ready for that 
and pushed her 
pawn again, 
turned and 
walked back across the room . 
There was a table there with a water pitcher 
and a few 
paper cups. She poured 
herself 
a cup, surprised 
to see that 
her hand trembled 
as she did 
so. By the time she got back 
to the board, 
Girev had moved again. She moved immediÂ­
ately, not bringing the rook 
to defend but abandoning the 
pawn and instead 
advancing her 
king. She picked 
the piece 
up lightly 
with her fingertips 
the way she had 
seen that 
piratical-looking 
man in Cincinnati do 
years before and 
dropped 
it on the queen four square, turned and walked 
away again. 
She kept it up that way, not sitting 
down at all. Within 
three quarters 
of an hour she had 
him. It was really 
simple-almost 
too easy. It was only a matter of trading 
rooks at the 
right time. The trade pulled 
his king back a 
square on the recapture
, just enough to let her 
pawn get by 

1 83 

WALTER TEVIS 

and queen. B ut Girev did not 
wait for that; 
he resigned 
immediately 
after the rook check and the 
trade which 
followed. He stepped 
toward her as if to say something, 
but seeing 
her face , stopped. 
For a moment she softene
d, 
remembering 
the child she had 
been only a few years 
before and how 
it devastated 
her to 
lose a chess game. 
She held out her hand, and when he shook it she forced 
a smile and said, "I've never been to a drive-in 
either." 
He shook his 
head. " I should 
not have let you 
do that. 
With the rook. " 
" Yes , " she said
. And then: "How old were you when 
you started 
playing 
chess? ' ' 
" Four. I was district 
champion 
at seven. 
I hope to be 
World Champion 
one day." 
' ' When?' ' 
" In three years. " 
" You' II be sixteen 
in three years. " 
He nodded grimly. 
" If you win, what will you do afterward?" 
He looked puzzled. 
" I don't understa
nd." 
" If you' re World Champion 
at sixteen, what 
will you 
do with the rest of your life?'' 
He still 
looked puzzled. "I don't understand
, " he said. 

Mrs. Wheatley 
went to bed early and seemed better 
the 
next morning. She was up before Beth, and when they 
went downstairs 
together for 
breakfast in the 
Camara de 
Toreros, Mrs . 
Wheatley 
ordered 
a Spanish 
omelet 
and two 
cups of coffee and finished 
it all . Beth felt relieved . 

On the bulletin 
board near the registration 
desk was a list 
of players; 
Beth had not 
looked at it for several 
days. 

1 84 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

Coming into the room 
now ten minutes 
before game time, 
she stopped 
and checked 
the scores. They were listed 
in 
order of their international 
ratings, and Borgov was at the 
top with 271 5 . Harmon was seventeenth 
with 2370. After 
each player's name was a series of boxes 
showing 
his 
score for the rounds. "0" meant a loss, " 112" a draw, 
and " 1 " a win. There were a great many " 112's. " Three 
names had an uninterrupted string 
of " 1 ' s " after them; 
Borgov and Harmon 
were two of 
these. 
The pairings 
were a few feet to the right. At the top of 
the list was BORGOV-RAND, and below that HARMON-SOÂ­
LOMON. If she and Borgov both won today, they would not 
necessarily 
play each other in the final game tomorrow. 
She was not sure whether 
she wanted to play him or not. 
Playing 
Girev had rattled 
her. She felt a dim unsureness 
about Mrs . Wheatley, despite 
her apparent 
resurgence; 
the 
image of her white skin, rouged cheeks and forced smiles 
made Beth uneasy. A buzz of voices 
had begun in the 
room as players 
found their 
boards, set up their clocks, 
settled 
into preparat
ions for play. Beth shook off her unease 
as well as she could and found Board Four-the 
first board 
in the big room-and waited 
for Solomon. 
Solomon 
was by no means easy, and the 
game lasted 
four hours before he was forced to resign. Yet at no point 
during all 
of that time 
did she 
ever lose her edge-the 
tiny 
advantage 
that the opening 
move gives to the player of the 
white pieces. Solomon 
did not say anythin
g , but she could 
tell from the way 
he stalked 
off afterward 
that he was 
furious 
to be beaten by 
a woman. She had seen it often 
enough before to recognize 
it. Usually 
it made her angry , 
but it 
didn't matter 
right now. She had something 
else on 
her mind. 

1 85 

WALTER TEVIS 

took out Grandmaster 

When he had 
gone she went to look in the smaller 
room 
where Borgov played, 
but it was empty. The winning 
position-Bor
gov' s-was still 
displayed 
on the big board 
on the wall; it was as devastating 
as Beth's win over 
Solomon 
had been. 
In the ballroom she looked at the bulletin 
board. Some 
of tomorrow's pairings 
were already 
up. That was a surÂ­
prise. 
She stepped 
closer 
to look, and her heart caught in 
her throat; 
at the top 
of the finals 
list in black printed 
letters 
was BORGOV-HARMON. She blinked 
and read it 
again, holding 
her breath. 
Beth had brought 
three books with her to Mexico City. 
She and 
Mrs. Wheatley 
ate dinner in their room, and 
afterward Beth 
Games; in it were 
five of Borgov's. She opened it 
to the first one and began 
to play through 
it, using her board and pieces. She seldom 
did this, generally 
relying 
on her ability 
to visualize 
a 
game when going over 
it, but she wanted to have B orgov 
in front of her as 
palpably 
as possible. 
Mrs. Wheatley lay 
in bed reading 
while Beth played through 
the games, 
looking 
for weaknesses. She found none. She played through 
them again, stopping 
in certain 
positions 
where the 
posÂ­
sibilities 
seemed nearly 
infinite, 
and working 
them all out . 
She sat staring 
a t the board with everything 
i n her present 
life obliterated 
from her attention 
while the combinations 
played themselves 
out in her head. Every now and then a 
sound from Mrs. Wheatley 
or a tension 
in the air of 
the 
room brought 
her out of 
it for a moment, 
and she looked 
around dazedly, feeling the pained 
tightness 
of her muscles 
and the 
thin, intrusive 
edge of fear in her stomach. 
There had been a few times over the past year when she

felt like this, with her mind not only dizzied 
but nearly 
of chess. 'By midnight 
terrified 
by the endlessness 
Mrs. 
Wheatley 
had put her book aside 
and gone quietly 
to sleep. 
Beth sat in the green armchair 
for hours, not hearing 
Mrs. 
Wheatley's gentle 
snores , not 
sensing 
the strange 
smell of 
a Mexican 
hotel in her nostrils, feeling somehow that she 
might fall from a precipice
, that sitting 
over the chessboard 
she had 
bought at Purcell ' s in Kentucky, she was 
actually 
poised 
over an abyss, sustained 
there only by the bizarre 
mental equipment 
that had fitted 
her for this elegant 
and 
deadly 
game. On the board there was danger 
everywhere
. A 
person could not rest. 
She did not go to bed until after four 
and, asleep, she 
dreamed 
of drowning. 

A few people had gathered 
in the ballroom. 
She recogÂ­
nized Marenco, dressed 
in a suit and tie 
now; he waved at 
her as 
she came 
in, and she forced herself 
to smile in his 
direction
. It was frightening to see 
even this player she had 
already 
beaten. She was jumpy, knew she was jumpy, and 
did not know what to do about 
it. 
She had 
showered at seven 
that morning, 
unable 
to rid 
herself 
of the tension 
she had awakened 
with. She was 
barely 
able to get down her morning 
coffee in the nearÂ­
empty coffee shop and had washed her face afterward, 
carefully, trying to focus herself. 
Now she crossed 
the 
ballroom' s red carpet and went 
to the ladies' 
room and 
washed her face 
again. She dried carefully with paper 
towels and combed her 
hair, watching 
herself 
in the big 
mirror. Her movements 
seemed forced, and her body 
looked 
impossibly 
frail. The expensive blouse 
and skirt did not fit 
right. 
Her fear was as sharp as a toothache
.

As she came down 
the hallway, 
she saw 
him. He was 
standing 
there solidly 
with two men she did not 
recognize. 
All of them wore dark suits. They were close together
, 
talking 
softly, confidentially
. She lowered her eyes and 
walked past them into 
the small room. Some men were 
waiting 
there with cameras. 
Reporters . 
She slipped 
behind 
the black pieces 
at Board One. She stared 
at the board 
for 
a moment, heard the tournament 
director's 
voice saying, 
"Play will begin in three minutes, " and looked 
up. 
Borgov was walking 
across 
the room toward her. His 
suit fit him 
well, with the trouser 
legs draping 
neatly 
above 
the tops of his shined 
black shoes. Beth turned her 
eyes 
back to the board, embarrassed
, feeling awkward. Borgov 
had seated himself. 
She heard the 
director
's voice as if 
from a great distance, 
" You may start your opponent's 
clock , ' ' and she 
reached 
out, pressed 
the button on the 
clock and looked up. He was sitting 
there solid, 
dark and 
heavy, 
looking 
fixedly 
at the board, 
and she watched 
as if 
in a dream as he reached 
out a stubby-
fingered 
hand, 
picked up the king pawn 
and set 
it on the fourth rank. 
Pawn to 
king four. 
She stared 
at it for a moment. 
She always played the 
Sicilian 
to that opening-the most common opening 
for 
White in the game of chess. But 
she hesitated. Borgov had 
been called 
" Master of the Sicilian" 
somewhere in a 
journal. Almost impulsively 
she played pawn to king four 
herself, 
hoping to play him on ground that 
was fresh for 
both of them, that would not give 
him the advantage 
of 
superior 
knowledge. 
He brought out his 
Icing's knight 
to 
bishop 
three, and she 
brought 
hers to queen bishop 
three, 
protecting 
the pawn. And then 
without 
hesitation 
he played 
his bishop to knight five and her heart sank. 
The Ruy

Lopez. She had played it often enough, 
but in this game it 
frightened 
her. It was as complex, 
as thoroughly 
analyzed, 
as the Sicilian, 
and there were dozens of lines she hardly 
knew, except 
for memorizing 
them from books. 
Someone flashed 
another 
bulb for a picture 
and she 
heard the tournament 
director' s angry whisper 
not to disÂ­
turb the players. 
She pushed her pawn up to rook three, 
attacking 
the bishop. 
Borgov pulled 
it back to rook 
four. 
She forced herself 
to concentrate, brought 
out her other 
knight, 
and Borgov castled
. All this was familiar, 
but it 
was no relief. 
She now had to 
decide to play either 
the 
open variation 
or the closed. 
She glanced 
up at Borgov' s 
face and then back a t the board. She took his pawn with 
her knight, starting the 
open. He played pawn to queen 
four, as she knew he would, 
and she played 
pawn to queen 
knight four because 
she had to
, so she would be ready 
when he moved the rook. The chandelier 
overhead 
was too 
bright. And now she 
began to 
feel dismay, 
as though the 
rest of the game were inevitable
-as though 
she were 
locked into some choreography 
of feints and counterthreats 
in which 
it was a fixed necessity 
that she lose, like a game 
from one of the books where you knew the outcome 
and 
played 
it only to see 
how it happened. 
She shook her head to clear it. The game had not 
gone 
that far. They were 
still 
playing 
out tired old moves and 
the only advantage 
White had was the advantage 
White 
always had-the first move. Someone had said that when 
computers really 
learned to play chess and played against 
one another, 
White would always win because 
of the first 
move. Like tick-tack-toe
. But it hadn't come to that. She 
was not playing 
a perfect 
machine. 
Borgov brought 
his bishop back 
to knight 
three, retreat-

1 89

ing. She played pawn to queen 
four, and he took the pawn 
and she brought 
her bishop to king three. She had known 
this much back at 
Methuen 
from the lines she memorized 
But the game was 
ready now to enter a wide-open 
phase, 
where it could take 
unexpected 
turns. She looked up just as Borgov, his face 
smooth and impassive, 
picked up his queen and set it 
in 
front of the king, on king two. She blinked 
at it for a 
moment. 
What was 
he doing? Going after 
the knight 
on 
her king five? He could 
pin the pawn that protected 
the 
knight 
easily enough 
with a rook. But 
the move looked 
somehow suspicio
us. She felt the tightness 
in her stomach 
again, a touch of dizziness. 
She folded 
her arms across 
her chest and began to 
study 
the position
. Out of the comer of 
her eye she could see the 
young man 
who moved the pieces 
on the display board 
placing 
the big cardboard white queen 
on the king two 
square. She glanced 
out into the room. There 
were about a 
dozen people 
standing 
there watching. She turned back to 
the board
. She would have to 
get rid of 
his bishop. 
Knight 
to rook four looked 
good for that. 
There was also knight 
to 
bishop four 
or bishop to 
king two
, but that was very 
complicated. 
She studied 
the possibilities 
for a moment 
and discarded 
the idea. She did not 
trust herself 
against 
Borgov with those complicati
ons. To put a knight 
on the 
rook file cut its range in half; but she did 
it. She had to get 
rid of the bishop. The bishop 
was up to no good. 
Borgov reached 
down without 
hesitation 
and played 
knight to queen four. She stared 
at it; she had expected 
him to move his rook. Still 
there seemed to be no 
harm in 
it. Pushing her 
queen bishop 
pawn up to the fourth square 
looked good. It would force Borgov' s knight 
to take her 

1 90 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

bishop, and after that she could take his bishop with her 
knight 
and stop the annoying pressure 
on her other knight, 
the one 
that sat a bit too far down the board 
on king five 
and didn't have enough flight 
squares for comfort. Against 
Borgov, 
the loss of a knight 
would be lethal. She played 
the queen bishop pawn, holding 
the piece for a moment 
between 
her fingers 
before letting 
it go. Then she 
sat a bit 
farther back in her chair and drew a deep breath. The 
position looked good. 
Without 
hesitation 
Borgov took the 
bishop with his 
knight, 
and Beth retook 
with her pawn
. Then he 
played 
his 
queen bishop pawn to the third rank, as she thought 
he 
might, 
creating 
a place for the nuisance 
bishop to hide. 
She took the bishop 
with relief, 
getting 
rid of it and getting 
her knight 
off the 
embarrassing 
rook file. Borgov remained 
impassive, taking the knight with his pawn. His eyes 
flicked up to hers and back to the position
. 
She looked down nervously. It had looked good a few 
moves before; it did not 
look so good now. The problem 
was her knight 
on king five. He could move 
his queen to 
knight four, threatening 
to take her king' s pawn with 
check, and when she 
protected 
against 
this, he could attack 
the knight 
with his king bishop pawn, and it would 
have 
no place to go. Borgov' s queen would be there to take it. 
There was another annoyance 
on her queen 
side: he could 
play rook takes pawn, giving 
up the 
rook to hers only to 
get it back with a queen check, coming 
out a pawn ahead 
and with an improved 
position. No. Two pawns ahead. 
She would have to put her queen 
on knight 
three. Queen 
to 
queen two was no good because 
of his damned bishop 
pawn that could 
attack 
her knight. 
She did not like this 
defensiveness 
and studied 
the board for a long time before 

1 9 1

Why hadn ' t she seen 

How could she have missed it? She had 

moving, 
trying 
to find something 
that would counterattack. 
There was nothing. 
She had to move the queen 
and protect 
the knight. 
She felt her cheeks burning and studied 
the 
position 
again. 
Nothing. 
She brought 
her queen to knight 
three and did not look at Borgov. 
With no hesitation 
whatever 
Borgov brought his 
bishop 
to king three, protecting 
his king. 
that? She had looked long enough. 
Now if she pushed the 
pawn she had planned 
to push, she would lose her queen. 
planned the threat 
of discovered check with the new position 
of her queen, 
and he had parried 
it instantly 
with a move that was 
chillingly 
obvious. She glanced at 
him, at his well-shaven, 
imperturbable 
Russian 
face with the tie so finely 
knotted 
beneath 
his heavy chin, and the fear she felt almost 
froze 
her muscles. 
She studied 
the board with all the intensity 
she could 
muster, 
sitting 
rigidly 
for twenty minutes 
staring at 
the 
position
. Her stomach 
sank even farther 
as she tried and 
rejected 
a dozen continuatio
ns. She could not save the 
knight. 
Finally 
she played her bishop to king two, and 
Borgov predictably 
put his queen 
on knight 
four, threatenÂ­
ing again to win the knight 
by pushing 
up his king bishop 
pawn. Now she had 
the choice of 
king to queen two or of 
castling. Either 
way the knight 
was lost. She castled. 
Borgov immediately 
moved the bishop pawn to attack 
her knight. 
She could have screamed. Everything 
he was 
doing was obvious, 
unimaginative, 
bureaucra
tic. She felt 
stifled 
and played 
pawn to 
queen five, attacking 
his bishop, 
and then watched 
his inevitable 
moving of the bishop to 
rook six, threatening to mate. She would have to 
bring her 

1 92 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

rook up to protect. He would take the knight with his 
queen, and if she took the bishop, the queen would pick 
off the rook in the corner 
with a check, and the whole 
thing would blow apart. She would have to bring the rook 
over to protect 
it. And meanwhile 
she was down a knight. 
Against 
a world's champion, 
whose shirt 
was impeccably 
white, 
whose tie was 
beautif
ully tied, whose dark jowled 
Russian 
face admitted 
no doubt or weakness. 
She saw 
her hand reach out, and taking 
the black king 
by its head, topple 
it onto 
the board. 
She sat 
there for a moment and heard the applause. 
Then, looking 
at no one, she 
left the room.

"Con mucho 

"Give me a tequila

. The clock over 
the 
bar pointed 
to twelve-thir

of the tables at 
the far end of the

Beth had not eaten

did not want lunch. 
gusto," the bartender 
said. 
The awards ceremony 
was at two-thirty. She drank 
through 
it in the bar. She would be fourth place, 
or maybe 
fifth. The two who had done a 
grandmaster 
draw together 
would be ahead of her with 
five and a half points 
each. 
Borgov had six. 
Her score was five. She had three tequila 
sunrises, ate two hard-boiled 
eggs and shifted to 
beer. Dos 
Equis. It took four of them to make the pain 
in her 
stomach 
go away, to blur the fury and shame. Even when 
it began to ease, she could still 
see Borgov's dark, heavy 
face and could feel the frustration 
she had felt 
during their 

1 94 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

match. She had played like a novice, 
like a passive
, 
embarrassed 
fool. 
She drank a lot, but she 
did not get 
dizzy, 
and her 
speech did not slur when she order
ed. There seemed to be 
a kind of 
insulation around her that kept 
everything 
at a 
distance. 
She sat at a table at one end 
of the cocktail 
lounge with her glass of beer, and she did 
not get drunk. 
At three 
o'clock two players from the tournament 
came 
into the bar, talking 
quietly. Beth got up and went straight 
to her room. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
was lying in bed. She had a hand on her 
head with the fingers 
dug into her hair as 
though she had a 
headache
. Beth walked over to the 
bed. Mrs. Wheatley 
did 
not look right. 
Beth reached 
out and 
took her by the arm. 
Mrs . Wheatley 
was dead. 
It seemed as though she felt nothing, 
but five minutes 
passed before Beth was able to let go of Mrs
. Wheatley
' s 
cold arm and pick u p the telephone. 
The manager 
knew exactly 
what to do. Beth sat 
in the 
armchair 
drinking 
cafe con leche from room service 
while 
two men with a stretcher 
came and the manager 
instructed 
them. She heard him, but she did not watch. She kept her 
eyes on the window. 
Sometime 
later she turned to see a 
middle-aged 
woman in a gray 
suit, 
using a stethoscope 
on 
Mrs. Wheatley
. Mrs. Wheatley was 
on the bed and 
the 
stretcher 
was under her. 
The two men in green uniform 
were standing 
at the 
edge of 
the bed, looking 
embarrassed. 
The woman took 
off her stethoscope, 
nodded to the manÂ­
ager and came over 
to Beth. Her face was strained. "I'm 
sorry, " 
she said. 
Beth looked away from her. " What was it?" 
"Hepatitis, possibly
. We'll know tomorrow. " 

1 95 

WALTER TEVIS 

" Tomorrow, " Beth said. " Could you give 
me a 
tranquilizer?' ' 
"I have a sedative 
. 
" I don' t want a sedative, " Beth said. "Can you give 
me a prescription for 
Librium?" 
The doctor stared at her for a moment and shrugged. 
" You don' t need a prescription 
to buy Librium in Mexico. 
I suggest 
meprobamate
. There' s a farmacia in the hotel. " 

' s Mobil Travel 

Using a map in the front of Mrs. Wheatley
Guide, Beth wrote down the names of the cities between 
Denver, 
Colorado, 
and Butte, Montana. 
The manager 
had 
told her his assistant 
would be of whatever help she 
needed 
in phoning, 
signing 
papers, dealing 
with the authorities. 
Ten minutes 
after they had 
taken Mrs. Wheatley 
away, 
Beth called 
the assistant 
and read him the list of towns and 
gave him the name. He said he would call her back. She 
ordered 
a Coca-Cola 
grande and more 
coffee from room 
service. Then she undressed 
quickly 
and took a shower. 
There was a phone in the bathr
oom, but the call did not 
come through. She still 
felt nothing. 
She dressed 
in fresh jeans and a white 
T-shirt. 
On the 
little 
table by the bed was 
Mrs. Wheatley
' s pack of ChesÂ­
terfields, 
empty, crumpled 
by Mrs. Wheatley
' s hands. The 
ashtray 
beside 
it was full of butts. One cigarette, the last 
one Mrs. Wheatley 
had ever 
smoked, sat on the edge of 
the little 
tray, with a long cold ash. Beth stared 
at it a 
minute; 
then she went into 
the bathroom 
and dried her 
hair. 
The boy who brought 
the big bottle 
of Coke and the 
carafe 
of coffee was very respectful 
and waved away her 

1 96 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

attempt 
to sign the bill. The telephone 
rang. It was the 
manager. "I 
have your call, " he said. "From Denver." 
There was a series 
of clicks 
in the receiver 
and then a 
male voice, 
surprisingly 
loud and clear. 
"This is Allston 
Wheatley
. ' ' 
"It's 
Beth, Mr. Wheatley
. " 
There was a pause. 
"Beth?" 
" Your daughter. 
Elizabeth Harmon. " 
" You're in Mexico? You
' re calling 
from Mexico?" 
"It's about Mrs . Wheatley
. " She was looking 
at the 
cigarette, never really 
smoked, 
on the ashtray
. 
"How's Alma?" the voice said. "Is she there with you? 
In Mexico?" 
The interest sounded 
forced. She could picÂ­
ture him as she had seen him at Methuen, 
wishing 
he were 
somewhere 
else, 
everything 
about him sayirig 
that he 
wanted 
to make no connecti
ons, wanted always to be somewhere 
else. 
"She ' s dead, Mr. Wheatley. She died this morning. " 
There was silence 
at the other end of the line. Finally 
she said, "Mr. Wheatley 
. . . " 
"Can' t you handle this for me?" he said. " I can't be 
going off to 
Mexico. " 
"They're going to do an autopsy 
tomorrow , and I've 
got to get new plane 
tickets
. I mean, get a new plane ticket 
for myself . . . 
' ' Her voice had suddenly 
gone weak and 
aimless . She picked up the coffee cup and took a drink 
from it. "I 
don't know where to bury her." 
Mr. Wheatley's voice came back with surprising crispÂ­
ness. "Call Durgin Brothers, in Lexington. 
There's a famÂ­
ily plot in her maiden name. Benson .' ' 
" What about the house?" 
"Look"-the voice was louder now-"I don' t want 

1 97 

WALTER TEVIS 

any part of this. I've got problems 
enough here in Denver. 
Get her up to Kentucky 
and bury 
her and the 
house is 
yours. Just make the mortgage 
payments
. Do you need 
money?'' 
" I don' t know. I don't know what it will cost." 
"I heard you were doing all 
right. 
The child prodigy 
thing. Can't you charge it or something?" 
' 'I can talk to the hotel manager. '' 
"Good. You do that. I'm strapped 
for cash right now, 
but you can have 
the house and the equity. 
Call the Second 
National 
Bank and ask for Mr. Erlich. 
That's E-r-1-i-c-h. 
Tell him I want you 
to have 
the house. 
He knows how to 
reach me.' ' 
There was silence 
again. 
Then she said, as strongly 
as 
she could, "Don ' t you want 
to know what she died of?" 
" What was 
it?" 
"Hepatitis, I think. They'll know tomorrow. " 
" Oh , " Mr. Wheatley 
said. "She was sick a lot." 

The manager 
and the 
doctor took care 
of everything--even 
the refund on Mrs. Wheatley
's plane ticket. Beth had to 
sign some official papers, 
had to absolve 
the hotel of 
responsibility 
and fill out government 
forms. One had the 
title " U . S . Customs-Transfer 
of Remains. " The manÂ­
ager got Durgin Brothers 
in Lexington. The assistant 
manÂ­
ager drove Beth to the airport 
the following 
day, with 
the 
hearse 
discreetly 
trailing 
them through 
the streets 
of MexÂ­
ico City and along 
the highway. 
She saw the metal coffin 
only once, looking 
out the window from the TWA waiting 
room. The hearse 
had driven 
up to the 707 at the gate and 
some men were unloading 
it in 
brilliant 
sunlight. 
They set it 
on a forklift, and she could 
hear the dim whine of the 

1 98 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

engine 
through the glass as it was raised 
to the level of the 
cargo hold. For a moment it trembled in the sunshine 
and 
she had 
a sudden horrific 
vision 
of it falling off the lift and 
crashing 
to the tarmac, spilling 
out the embalmed 
middleÂ­
aged corpse 
of Mrs . Wheatley 
on the hot gray asphalt. 
B ut 
that did not happen. The casket 
was pulled 
handily 
into the 
cargo hold. 
On board Beth declined 
a drink 
from the stewar
dess. 
When she had gone back down the aisle, Beth opened her 
purse and took out one of her 
new bottles 
of green pills. 
She had spent three hours the day before, after signing 
the 
papers, going from farmacia to farmacia, 
buying the limit 
of one hundred 
pills 
in each. 

The funeral was simple and brief. 
A half-hour before it 
began, Beth 
took four green pills. She sat 
in the church 
alone, 
in a quiet daze, while the minister 
said the things 
ministers 
say. There were flowers 
at the altar, 
and she was 
mildly surprised 
to see a pair of men from the funeral 
horne step up and carry them out as soon as 
the minister 
had finished. 
Six other people were there, but Beth knew 
none of them. One old lady hugged her afterward and said, 
" You poor dear. " 
She finished 
unpacking 
that afternoon and 
came down 
from the bedroom to fix coffee. While the water was 
corning to a boil she 
went into the little 
downstairs 
bathÂ­

thing hot exploded 
in her belly and her face was drenched 
with tears. She took a towel from the rack and held it

against 
her face and said ' 'Oh Jesus Christ'' and leaned 
against 
the washbasin 
and cried for a long time. 
She was still 
drying her 
face when the phone rang. 
The voice was male. " Beth Hannon?" 
" Yes . " 
"This i s Harry Beltik. 
From the State Tournament." 
" I remember. 
" 
" Yeah. I hear you dropped 
one to Borgov. Wanted to 
give condolences
. " 
As she 
laid the towel on the back of the overstuf
fed sofa 
she noticed 
a half-finished 
pack of Mrs. Wheatley
' s cigaÂ­
rettes 
on its arm. "Thanks, " she said, picking 
up the packÂ­
age and holding 
on to it tightly. 
"What were you playing? 
White?" 
" Black . " 
" Yeah . " There was a pause. 
" Is something 
wrong?" 
"No . " 
"It's 
better 
that way." 
" What's better?" 
"It's 
better 
to be Black if you're going to lose it." 
"I suppose 
so. " 
"What'd you play? Sicilian?" 
She gently set the 
package 
of cigarettes 
back on the 
chair ann. 
" Ruy Lopez. I let him do it to 
me. " 
"Mistake, " Beltik 
said. "Look, I ' m in Lexington 
for 
the summer. 
Would you like some training?" 
"Training?" 
" I know. You're better 
than me. But if 
you're going to 
play Russians
, you'll need help . " 
" Where are you?" 
"At the Phoenix 
Hotel. I'm moving to an apartment

She looked around 
the room for a moment, 
at the stack 
of Mrs. Wheatley
's women' s magazines 
on the cobbler's 
bench, 
the pale-blue 
drapes 
on the windows, 
the oversized 
ceramic 
lamps with 
the cellophane 
still wrapped 
around 
their yellowing 
shades. She took in a long breath 
and let it 
out silently. 
"Come on over," she said
. 
He drove up 
twenty minutes 
later in a 1 955 Chevrolet 
with red-and-black 
flames painted 
on the fenders and a 
broken headlamp, 
pulling 
up to the curb at the end of the 
patterned-brick 
walk. She had been watching 
for him from 
the window and was on the front porch when he got out of 
the car. He waved at her and went 
to the trunk . He was 
wearing 
a bright-red shirt and gray corduroy 
pants with a 
pair of sneakers that 
matched 
the shirt. 
There was someÂ­
thing dark and quick about him, and Beth, remembering 
his bad teeth and his fierce way of playing 
chess, felt 
herself 
stiffen a little 
at the sight of him. 
He bent over 
the trunk and lifted out a cardboard 
box, 
clearly 
heavy, tossed 
the hair out of 
his eyes and came up 
the walk. The box said HEINZ TOMATO KETCHUP in 
red letters
; it was open at the top and filled with books. 
He set it on the living-room rug and unceremoniously 
took Mrs . 
Wheatley's magazines 
from the coffee 
table and 
slipped 
them into the magazine 
rack. He began taking 
books out of 
the box one at a time, reading off 
the titles 
and piling 
them on the table. 
"A. L. Deinkopf, 
J . R . Capablanca, 

Middle 
Game Strategy; 
My Chess Career; 
Fomaut, Alekhine' 
s Games 1 938-1945; Meyer, Rook and 
Pawn Endings. " 

Some of 
them were books she had seen before; a few of 
them she owned
. But most were 
new to her, heavy-looking 
and depressing 
to see. She knew there were 
a great many 

20 1 

WALTER TEVIS 

things 
she needed to know. But Capablanca 
had almost 
never studied, 
had played on intuition 
and his natural 
gifts, 
while inferior 
players like 
Bogolubov 
and Griinfeld memoÂ­
rized lines of play like German pedants. 
She had seen 
players at tournament 
after their games had ended, sitting 
motionless 
in uncomfortable 
chairs 
oblivious 
to the world, 
studying 
opening 
variations 
or middle-game 
strategy 
or 
endgame theory. 
It was endless. 
Seeing Beltik 
methodiÂ­
cally removing 
one heavy book after another, 
she felt 
weary and disorient
ed. She glanced over at the TV: a part 
of her 
wanted to tum it on and forget chess forever. 
"My summer's reading, " Beltik 
said. 
She shook her head irrita
bly. "I study 
books. But I've 
always tried to play it by ear." 
He stopped
, holding three copies of 
in his hands, 
their covers worn with 
use, frowning at her. 
" Like Morphy, " he said, " or Capablanca?" 
She was embarrassed. 
"Yes." 
He nodded grimly and set the stack of bulletins 
on the 
floor by the coffee table. ' 'Capablanca 
would have beaten 
Borgov.' ' 
" Not every game." 
" Every game that counted, " Beltik said. 
She studied 
his face. He was younger 
than she rememÂ­
bered him. But she was older now. He was an uncomproÂ­
mising 
young man; every part of 
him was uncompromising. 
" You think I'm a prima donna, don't you?" 
He .permitted 
himself 
a small smile
. " We're all prima 
donnas, " he said. "That's chess for you ." 
When she put the TV dinners 
in the oven that night, 
they had two boards set up with endgame 
positions: 
his set 
with its green and cream squares, its heavy plastic 
pieces;

her wooden board with its rosewood 
and maple men. Both 
sets were the Staunton pattern that 
all serious 
players used; 
both had four-inch kings. She hadn't invited him to 
stay 
for lunch and dinner; 
it had been understo
od. He went to 
the grocery 
store a few blocks away for 
the food while she 
sat musing over a group of possible 
rook moves, trying 
to 
avoid a draw in a theoretical 
game. While she made lunch 
he lectured 
her about keeping 
in good physical 
shape and 
getting 
enough sleep. He had also bought the two 
frozen 
dinners for 
supper. 
" You've got to stay open, " Beltik 
said. " If you get 
locked 
into one idea-like 
this king knight 
pawn, say-it' s 
death. Look at this . . . ' ' She turned to his board o n the 
kitchen 
table. 
He was holding 
a cup of coffee and standÂ­
ing, frowning down at the board, holding his chin 
with the 
other hand. 
" Look at what?" she said, irritated
. 
He reached 
down, picked 
up the white rook, moved 
it 
across 
the board to king rook one-the lower right-hand 
comer. "Now his rook pawn's pinned. " 
"So what?" 
" He's got to move the 
king now or he 
gets stuck later. " 
" I see that, " she said, her voice a little 
softer now. 
" But I don't see-" 
"Look at the queenside 
pawns, way over here." He 
pointed 
to the other side of 
the board, at the three white 
pawns interlinked. 
She walked over to the table to get a 
better 
look. "He can do this, " she said
, and moved the 
black rook over two squares. 
Beltik 
looked up at her. "Try it. " 
" Okay . " She sat down behind the pieces. 
In half a dozen moves 
Beltik 
had gotten his 
queen 

203 

WALTER TEVIS 

bishop pawn to the seventh 
rank and queening 
it was 
inevita
ble. It would cost the rook and the game to stop it. 
He had been right; 
it was necessary to move the king when 
the rook had come 
across 
the board. " You were right, " 
she said. "Did you figure 
i t out?" 
"It's from Alekhine 
somewhere, " he said. "I got it 
from a book . " 
Beltik 
went back to 
his hotel after midnight, 
and Beth 
stayed 
up for several 
hours reading 
the middle-game 
book, 
not setting 
up the positions 
on a board but reviewing 
them 
in her imagination. 
One thing bothered 
her, but 
she did not 
let herself 
dwell on it. She could not picture 
the pieces as 
easily 
as she had 
when she was eight and nine years old. 
She could still 
do it, but it was more of an effort and 
sometimes 
she was uncertain 
about where a pawn or a 
bishop 
belonged 
and had to 
retrace 
the moves in 
her mind 
to make sure. She 
played 
on doggedly 
into the night, 
using 
her mind and the book only, sitting 
in Mrs. Wheatley
's old 
television-
watching 
armchair 
in T-shirt 
and blue jeans. 
Every now and then she would blink and 
look around her, 
half expecting 
to see 
Mrs. Wheatley 
sitting 
nearby with 
her stockings rolled 
down and her black pumps 
on the 
floor beside 
her chair. 
Beltik 
was back at nine the next morning, with half a 
dozen more books. They had coffee and played a few 
five-minute games on 
the kitchen 
table. 
Beth won all of 
them, decisively, 
and when they 
had finished 
the fifth 
game Beltik looked at her and 
shook his head. " Harmon, " 
he said, "you have really 
got it. But it's improvisation
. " 
She sta
red at 
him. ' 'What the hell, ' ' she said. ' 'I wiped 
you out five times. " 
He looked back across the table at her 
coolly 
and took a 

204 

THE QUEEN'S

sip from his coffee cup. ' 'I'm a master, " he said, " and 
I've never played better 
in my life. But I'm not 
what 
you're going to be up against 
if you go to Paris. " 
" I can beat Borgov with a little 
more work . " 
" You can beat Borgov with a lot more work. Years 
more work. What in hell do you think he is? Another 
Kentucky 
ex-champion like 
me?" 
"He's World Champion. But-" 
"Oh, shut up! " Beltik 
said. " Borgov could have beaten 
both of us when he was ten. Do you know his career?' ' 
Beth looked at him. "No, I don't." 
Beltik 
got up from the table and walked purposively 
into 
the living 
room. He pulled 
a green-j
acketed 
book from the 
stack next to Beth's chessboard and brought 
it to the 
kitchen, 
tossing 
it on the table in front of her. Vasily

' ' Read the games from 
Leningrad 1 962 and look at the

endings. 
Look at the games with

nearÂ­
empty cof
fee cup. " You might learn something

It was the 
first week in June and japonica 
blazed 
in bright 
coral outside 
the kitchen 
window. 
Mrs. Wheatley
's azaleas 
had begun to bloom and the grass 
needed mowing. There 
were birds. It was a beautiful 
week of the best kind of 
Kentucky 
spring. 
Sometimes 
late at night after Beltik 
had 
left, Beth would go out to the backyard to 
feel the warmth 
on her cheeks and to take a few deep breaths 
of warm 
clean air, but the rest of the time she 
ignored 
the world 
outside. 
She had become caught 
up in chess in a new way. 
Her bottles 
of Mexican 
tranquilizers remained 
unused in 
the nightstand; 
the cans of beer in the refrigerator 
stayed 
in 

205 

WALTER TEVIS 

the refrigerator. 
After standing 
in the backyard 
for five 
minutes, she would go 
back into the house and read Beltik' s 
chess books for hours and then g o upstairs 
and fall into 
bed exhausted.

On Thursday 
afternoon Beltik said, " I ' m supposed 
move into an apartment 
tomorrow. The hotel 
bill is killing 
me.' ' 
They were in the middle of the Benoni Defense. She 
had just played the 
P-K5 he had taught 
her, on move 
eight-a move Beltik 
said came from a player named 
Mikenas. 
She looked up from the 
position. 
" Where is it? 
The apartment. ' ' 
"New Circle 
Road. I won't be coming by so much . " 
"It's not 
that far." 
"Maybe not. But I'll be taking 
classes. 
I ought 
to get a 
part-time 
job.' ' 
" You could move in here , " she said. "Free . " 
He looked at her 
for a moment 
and smiled. His teeth 
weren't really 
so bad. " I thought 
you'd never ask , " he 
said. 

She had not been so immersed 
in chess since she was a 
little girl
. Beltik 
was in class three afternoons a week and 
two mornings, 
and she spent that time studying 
his books. 
She played mentally 
through 
game after game, learning 
new variati
ons, seeing 
stylistic differences in offense and 
defense, biting 
her lip sometimes in excitement 
over a 
dazzling 
move or a subtlety 
of position
, and at 
other times 
wearied by a sense of the hopeless 
depth of chess, 
of its 
endlessnes
s, move after move, threat 
after threat, complicaÂ­
tion after complication. 
She had heard of the genetic 
code 
that could shape an eye or hand from passing 
proteins.

Deoxyribonucleic 
acid. It contained 
the entire set 
of inÂ­
structions 
for constructing 
a respiratory system and a diÂ­
gestive 
one, as well as the grip of an infant's hand. Chess 
was like that. The geometry 
of a position 
could be read 
and reread and not exhausted 
of possibility. 
You saw 
deeply into this layer of it, but there was another 
layer 
beyond that, and another. 
Sex, with its reputation 
for complexity
, was refreshingly 
simple. 
At least for Beth 
and Harry. They were in bed 
together 
on his second night 
in the house. It took ten 
minutes 
and was punctuated 
by a few sharp intakes 
of 
breath. She had no orgasm, and his was restrained. 
AfterÂ­
ward he went 
to his bed in her old room and she slept 
easily, 
falling asleep to 
images not of love but of 
wooden 
counters 
on a wooden board. The next morning she played 
him at breakfast 
and the combinations 
arose from her 
fingertips 
and spread 
themselves 
on the board as prettily 
as 
flowers. She beat him four quick games, letting 
him play 
the white pieces 
each time and hardly 
looking 
at the board. 
While he 
was washing 
the dishes he 
talked 
about Philidor, 
one of his 
heroes. Philidor 
was a French musician 
who had 
played 
blindfolded 
in Paris and London. 
"I read about those 
old players sometimes, and it all 
seems strange, " she said. "I 
can't believe 
it was really 
chess . ' ' 
" Don't knock it, " Beltik 
said. " Bent Larsen plays 
Philidor's 
Defense. " 
" It's too cramped. The king's bishop 
gets locked 
in. " 
"It's solid
, " he said. " What I wanted to tell you about 
Philidor 
was that Diderot 
wrote him a letter. 
You know 
Diderot?" 
"The French Revolution
?" 

207 

WALTER TEVIS 

" Yeah. Philidor 
was doing blindfold exhibitions 
and 
burning out his brain , or whatever 
it was they thought 
you 
did in the eighteenth 
century. Diderot 
wrote him: 
' It is 
foolish to run the risk of going mad for vanity ' s sake.' I 
think of that sometimes 
when I'm analyzing 
my ass off 
over a chessboard. " He looked at her quietly 
for a moÂ­
ment. " Last night was 
nice, " he said. 
She sensed 
that for him it 
was a concession 
to talk about 
it, and her feelings 
were mixed. "Doesn't Koltanowski 
play blindfolded 
all the time?' ' she said. ' 'He's not crazy.' ' 
" I know. It was Morphy who went crazy. And Steinitz. 
Morphy thought 
people 
were trying 
to steal his shoes. " 
"Maybe he thought 
shoes were bishops." 
" Yeah , " he said. "Let's play chess." 

Shakhmatni 

By the end of the third week she had gone through his 
four 
bulletins 
and most of the other game books. 
One day after he 
had been in an engineering 
class all 
morning they 
were studying 
a position 
together. 
She was 
trying 
to show him why a particular knight move was 
stronger 
than it looked. 
" Look here, " she said and began moving the 
pieces 
around fast. " Knight takes and then this pawn comes up. 
If he doesn' t bring it up, the bishop 
is locked in. When he 
does, the other 
pawn falls. Zip." She took the pawn off. 
" What about the other bishop? 
Over here?' ' 
"Oh , for Christ's 
sake, " she said. " It'll have the check 
once the pawn is moved and 
the knight's traded. Can't you 
see that?'' 
Suddenly 
he froze and glared at 
her. "No, I can't," he 
said. " I can' t find it that fast. " 

208 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

She looked back at 
him. "I wish you could, " she said 
levelly. 
" You're too sharp for me. " 
She could see the hurt underneath 
his anger, and she 
softened. "I miss them too, sometimes
, " she said. 
He shook his head. "No, you don ' t , " he said. " Not 
anymore . " 

On Saturday she 
started 
playing 
him with odds of 
a knight. 
He tried to act casual about 
it, but she 
could see that he 
hated it. There was no other way for them to 
have a real 
game. Even with the odds and with his playing the white 
pieces 
she beat him the first two and drew the third. 
That night he did not come to her bed, nor did he the 
next. She 
did not miss the sex, which meant very little 
to 
her, but she 
missed something. On the second 
night she 
had some difficulty 
going to sleep and found herself 
getÂ­
ting up at two in the morning. She went to the ref
rigerator 
and got out one of Mrs. Wheatley
' s cans of 
beer. Then she 
sat down at the 
chessboard and began idly moving the 
pieces ar
ound, sipping 
from the can. She played 
over some 
Queen' s Gambit games: Alekhine-
Yates; Tarrasch-von 
Scheve; 
Lasker-Tarrasch. The first of these was one she 
had memorized years 
before at Morris' Book Store; 
the 
other two she had 
analyzed 
with Beltik during 
their first 
week together. 
In the last 
there was a beautiful pawn to 
queen ' s rook four on the fifteenth 
move, as sweetly 
deadly 
as a pawn move could be. She left it on the board for the 
time it took to drink two beers, just looking 
at it. It 
was a 
warm night and the kitchen 
window was open; moths 
battered 
at the screen 
and somewhere far away a dog was 
barking. She sat at the table 
wearing 
Mrs. Wheatley
' s pink 

209 

WALTER TEVIS 

chenille 
robe and drinking 
Mrs. Wheatley
' s beer, feeling 
relaxed 
and easy 
in herself. 
She was 
glad to be alone. 
There were three more beers in the refrigerator, 
and she 
finished 
all of 
them. Then she went back up to bed and 
slept soundly 
until nine in the morning. 

On Monday at breakfast he said, "Look, I've taught 
you 
everything 
I know. ' ' 
She started 
to say something 
but kept silent. 
"I've got to 
start studying. I'm 
supposed 
to be an 
electrical 
engineer, 
not a chess bum. " 
" Okay, " she said. " You've taught me 
a lot . " 
They were quiet for a few minutes. She finished 
her 
eggs and took her plate to the sink. "I'm moving to 
that 
apartment," Beltik 
said. "It's closer 
to the university
. " 
" Okay , " Beth said, not turning from the sink. 
He was gone by noon. She took a TV dinner 
from the 
freezer for her lunch but didn't tum on the oven. She was 
alone in the house, 
her stomach 
was in a knot, and she did 
not know any place to go. There were no movies she 
wanted to see or people she wanted to 
call; there was 
nothing 
she wanted to read. She walked up the stairs 
and 
through 
the two bedr
ooms. Mrs. Wheatley' s dresses 
still 
hung in the closets and 
a half bottle 
of her tranquilizers 
was still 
on the nightstand 
by the unmade bed. The tension 
she felt would 
not go away. Mrs. Wheatley 
was gone, her 
body buried 
in a cemetery at 
the edge of town, and Harry 
Beltik 
had driven 
off with his chessboard and books, not 
even waving goodbye as 
he left. For a moment she had 
wanted to shout at him to stay with her, 
but she said 
nothing 
as he went down the steps and into his car. She 
took the bottle 
from the nightstand 
and shook three of the 

2 1 0 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

green pills into her 
hand, and then a fourth. She hated 
being alone. 
She swallowed 
the four pills without 
water, 
the way she had 
as a child. 
In the afternoon she 
bought herself 
a steak and a large 
baking potato 
at Kroger's. Before pushing 
her cart to the 
checkout, 
she went to the wine-and-beer 
case and took out 
a fifth of burgundy. That night she watched 
television 
and 
got drunk. She went to sleep on the 
couch, only barely 
able to get to the set to tum it off. 
Sometime 
during 
the night she awoke to a sense that the 
room was reeling. She had to vomit. 
Afterward
, when she 
went upstairs 
to bed, she found that she was fully awake 
and very clear in her mind. There was a burning sensation 
in her stomach, and her eyes were wide open in the dark 
room as though looking 
for light. 
There was a powerful 
ache at the 
back of her neck. She reached 
over, found the 
bottle 
and took more 
tranquilizers
. Eventually 
she went to 
sleep again. 
She awoke the next morning with a 
crushing 
headache 
and a determination 
to get 
on with her career. Mrs. 
Wheatley 
was dead. Harry Beltik 
was gone. The U . S . Championship 
was in three weeks; she had 
been invited 
to it before going 
to Mexico, 
and if she was going to 
win it, 
she was going 
to have to beat Benny Watts . 
While her coffee was percoÂ­
lating 
in the kitchen, she poured out the leftover 
burgundy 
from the night before, threw away the empty bottle 
and 
found two books 
she had ordered 
from Morris' the day 
the 
invitation 
had come. One 
was the game record from the 
last U . S . Championship 
and the other was 
called 

Benny 
Watts: My Fifty Best Games of Chess. On its dustjacket 

was a blowup of Benny's Huckleber
ry Finn face. Seeing it 
now, she winced at the 
memory of losing, 
at her damnfool 

2 11 

WALTER TEVIS 

attempt 
to double his pawns. She got herself 
a cup of 
coffee and opened the book, forgetting 
her hangover. 
By noon she had 
analyzed 
six of the games and was 
getting 
hungry. There was 
a little restaurant 
two blocks 
away, the kind of 
place that has liver and onions on the 
menu and display cards of cigarette 
lighters at the cashier
' s 
stand. She brought 
the book with her 
and went over two 
more games while eating 
her hamburger 
and home fries. 
When the lemon custard came and was 
too thick and sweet 
to eat, she felt a sudden pang of longing for 
Mrs. Wheatley 
and the French desserts 
they had 
shared in places 
like 
Cincinnati 
and Houston. 
She shook it off, ordered 
a last 
cup of coffee and finished 
the game she was going over: 
the King's Indian 
Defense, with the black bishop 
fianchettoed 
in the 
upper right-hand 
comer of the board, looking 
down 
the long diagonal 
for a chance to pounce. 
B lack worked 
the king' s side while White worked the queen' s side after 
the bishop went into the comer. Very civilized. 
Benny, 
playing 
Black, won it 
handily. 
She paid her check and left . For the rest 
of the day and 
night until one in the morning she played over 
all of the 
games in the book. When she had finished, 
she knew a 
great deal more about Benny Watts and about precision 
chess than she had 
known before. She took two of her 
Mexican 
tranquilizers and went to bed, falling asleep 
inÂ­
stantly. She awoke pleasantly 
at nine-thirty the next mornÂ­
ing. While her breakfast 
eggs were boiling, 
she chose a 
book for morning study: 
of Chess. It was an old book, in 
some ways 
outdated. The 
diagrams 
were grayish 
and cluttered, and 
it was hard to 
tell 
the black pieces 
from the white. 
But something 
in her 
could still 
thrill at the name Paul 
Morphy and at 
the idea of 

Paul Morphy and the Golden Age 

2 1 2 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

that strange 
New Orleans 
prodigy, well-br
ed, a lawyer, 
son of a high court 
judge, 
who when young dazzled the 
world with his chess and then quit playing 
altogether 
and 
lapsed 
into muttering 
paranoia 
and an early death. When 
Morphy played the King's Gambit he 
sacrificed 
knights 
and bishops 
with abandon 
and then moved in on the black 
king with dizzying 
speed. There had never been anything 
like him before or since. 
It made her spine tingle 
just to 
open the book and see the games list: 
Morphy-Lowenthal; 
Morphy-Harrwitz; 
Morphy-Anderssen, 
followed by dates 
in the eighteen-fif
ties. Morphy would stay up all 
night in 
Paris before his games, drinking 
in cafes and talking 
with 
strangers
, and then would play the next day like a sharkÂ­
well-mannered, well-dressed, 
smiling, 
moving the big 
pieces 
with small, ladylike, blue-veined 
hands, 
crushing 
one EuÂ­
ropean master after another. 
Someone had 
called 
him " the 
pride and the sorrow of 
chess. ' ' If only he and Capablanca 
had lived at the same time and played each other! 
She 
began going over a game between 
Morphy and someone 
named Paulsen, played in 1 85 7 . The U . S . Championship 
would be in three weeks; it was time it was won by a 
woman. It 
was time she won it.

of Chess Review a few 

When she came into the room, she saw a thin young 
man 
wearing 
faded blue jeans 
and a matching 
denim shirt seated 
at one of the tables. His blond hair came almost to his 
shoulders
. It was only when he rose and said, "Hello, 
Beth , " that she saw 
it was Benny 
Watts. The hair had 
been long in the cover photograph 
months before, but not that long. He looked pale and thin 
and very calm. Stil l , Benny had always been calm. 
"Hello, " she said. 
" I read about the game with Borgov. " Benny smiled. 
"It must have felt terribl
e." 
She looked at him suspicious
ly, but his face was open 
and sympathetic. And she did not 
hate him anymore 
for 
beating 
her; there was only one player 
she hated now, and 
he was in Russia. 
"I felt 
like a fool, " she said. 

2 1 4 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

"I know . " He shook his head. " Helpless
. It all goes, 
and you just push wood. " 
She stared 
at him. Chess players did not talk so easily 
about humiliations, did not 
admit weaknes
s . She started to 
say something, when the 
tournament 
director 
spoke up 
loudly. "Play will 
begin in five minutes. " She nodded to 
Benny, attempted 
a smile, and found her table. 
There wasn't a face over a chessboard that she didn' t 
know from hotel ballrooms 
where tournaments 
were played 
or from photographs 
in Chess Review. She herself 
had 
been on the cover six months after Townes took her picÂ­
ture in Las Vegas. Half the other players here 
on this 
campus in the small Ohio town had been on the cover 
themselves 
at one time or 
another. 
The man she was 
playing now in her first game, a middle-a
ged master named 
Phillip Resna
is, was on the cover of the current 
issue. 
There were fourteen 
players, 
many of them grandmasters
. 
She was the only woman. 
They played in some kind of lecture 
room with darkÂ­
green blackboards along 
the wall at one end and fluoresÂ­
cent lights 
recessed into 
the ceiling. 
There was a row of 
large institutional 
windows 
along one blue 
wall, with bushes, 
trees and a wide stretch 
of the campus visible 
through 
them. At one end of the room were five 
rows of folding 
chairs, 
and out in 
the hallway 
a sign announced 
a visitor's 
fee of four dollars per session
. During her first game there 
were about twenty-f
ive people watching. A display 
board 
hung above each 
of the seven game tables, and two direcÂ­
tors moved silently between 
the tables, changing 
the pieces 
after moves had 
been made on the real boards. The spectaÂ­
tors' seats were on a wooden platform to give them a view 
of the 
playing surfaces.

But it was all 
second-r
ate, even 
the university 
they were 
playing 
at. They 
were the highest-ranked 
players in the 
country, assembled 
here in a single 
room, but it had the 
feel of a high school 
tournament. 
If it were golf or tennis, 
Benny Watts and she would be surrounded 
by reporters, 
would be playing 
under something 
other than these fluoÂ­
rescent 
lights 
and on plastic 
boards with cheap plastic 
pieces, watched 
by a few polite 
middle-a
ged people with 
nothing 
better 
to do. 
Phillip 
Resnais 
seemed to 
take it all seriously, but she 
felt like walking 
out. She did not, however. 
When he 
played 
pawn to king four, she pushed up her queen 
bishop 
pawn and started 
the Sicilian 
Defense. Now she was in the 
middle of 
the Rossolimo-Ni
mzovitch 
Attack, 
getting 
equalÂ­
ity on the eleventh 
move with pawn to queen three. It was 
a move she had 
gone over 
with Beltik, and it worked the 
way Beltik 
said it 
would work. 
By the fourteenth 
move she had him on the run, and by 
the twentieth 
it was decisive. 
He resigned 
on the twentyÂ­
sixth. She looked around her at 
the other games, all 
of 
them still 
in progress, and felt better 
about the whole 
thing. 
It would be good to be U . S . Champion. If she could 
beat Benny Watts. 

She had 
a small private 
room in a dormitory 
with the 
bathroom 
down the hall. It was austerely 
furnished, but 
there was 
no sense of anyone else's having lived in it, and 
she liked that. For the first several 
days she took her meals 
alone in the cafeteria 
and spent 
the evenings 
either 
at the 
desk in her room or in bed, studying. She had brought 
a 
suitcase 
full of chess books 
with her. They were lined up 
neatly at the back of the desk. She had also brought 

2 1 6 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

tranquiliz
ers, just in case, but she did not even 
open the 
bottle during the 
first week. Her one 
game a day went 
smoothly, 
and although 
some of them lasted 
three or four 
hours and were grueling, she was 
never in danger of 
losing. As time 
went on, the other players looked at her 
with more and more respect. 
She felt serious, professional, 
sufficient. 
Benny Watts was doing as well as she. The games 
were 
printed 
up every night from 
a Xerox in the college 
library, 
and copies 
were given to the players and spectators
. She 
went over 
them in the evenings 
and mornings, playing 
some out on her 
board but going through 
most of 
them in 
her head. She always took the trouble 
to set up the game 
Benny had played 
and actually 
move the pieces, 
carefully 
studying 
the way 
he had played it. In a round robin 
each 
player met each 
of the others 
one time; she would meet 
Benny in the eleventh 
game. 
Since there were thirteen 
games and the tournament 
lasted 
two weeks, there 
was one 
day off-the first Sunday. 
She slept late that morning, stayed a long 
time in the 
shower, 
and then took a long walk 
around the campus. It 
was very 
tranquil, with well-mowed lawns and elm 
trees 
and an occasional 
patch of flowers-a serene 
Midwestern 
Sunday morning, but she missed the competition of 
the 
match. She momentarily 
considered 
walking 
into the town, 
where she had heard there were a dozen places to 
drink 
beer, but thought 
better 
of it. 
She did not 
want to erode 
any more brain ce
lls. She looked at her watch; it was 
eleven o'clock. She headed for the Student 
Union BuildÂ­
ing, where the cafeteria 
was. She would get 
some coffee. 
There was a pleasant 
wood-paneled 
lounge on the main 
floor. 
When she came in, Benny Watts was sitting 
on a 

2 1 7 

WALTER TEVIS 

beige corduroy 
sofa at the far end of it with a chessboard 
and clock on the table in front of him. Two other players 
were standing 
nearby, and he was smiling 
at them, exÂ­
plaining something 
about the game in front of him. 
She had started 
downstairs for the cafeteria 
when BenÂ­
ny's voice called to her. 
"Come on over." She hesitated
, 
turned and walked over. She recognized 
the other two 
players at once; one of them she had 
beaten two days 
before with the Queen' s Gambit. 
"Look at this, Beth, " Benny said, pointing 
to the board. 
" White' s move. What would you do?" 
She looked at it a moment. 
' 'The Lopez?'' 
"That's right. " 
She was a little 
irrita
ted. She wanted a cup of coffee. 
The position 
was delicate, 
and it took concentrat
ion. The 
other players remained 
silent. 
Finally 
she saw what was 
needed. She bent over wordlessly, 
picked up the knight 
at 
king three and set it down on queen five. 
"See!" Benny said 
to the others, laughing
. 
" Maybe you're right," one of them said. 
"I know I'm right. 
And Beth here thinks the same 
way I 
do. The pawn move's too weak . " 
"The pawn works only if he plays his bishop, " Beth 
said, feeling better. 
"Exactly! " Benny said. He was wearing 
jeans and some 
kind of loose white blouse. 
"How about some 
skittl
es, 
Beth?" 
"I was on my way for coffee, " she said. 
" Barnes'll get you coffee. Won't you, Barnes?'' A big, 
soft-looking 
young man, a grandmaster
, nodded 
assent. 
"Sugar and cream?" 
" Yes . " 

2 1 8 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

Benny was pulling 
a dollar 
bill out of 
his jeans pocket. 
He handed it to Barnes . "Get me some apple juice. But 
not in one of those plastic 
cups. Get a 
milk glass. " 
Benny set the 
clock by the board. He held out two 
pawns concealed 
in his hands, 
and the hand 
Beth tapped 
had the white one. After they set up the pieces 
Benny said, 
" Would you like to bet?" 
' ' Bet?'' 
" We could play for five dollars a game." 
"I haven't had my coffee yet . " 
"Here i t comes. " Beth saw Barnes hurrying 
across 
the 
room with a glass of juice and a white Styrofoam 
cup. 
"Okay , " she said. "Five dollars . " 
"Have some coffee," Benny said, " and I'll punch your 
clock.' ' 
She took it from Barnes, had a long drink and set the 
half-empty 
cup on the coffee table. "Go ahead , " she said 
to Benny. She felt very good. The spring 
morning outÂ­
doors was all right, 
but this was what she loved. 
He beat her with only 
three minutes 
on his clock. 
She 
played well but he played brilliantly, moving almost imÂ­
mediately 
each time, seeing through 
whatever 
she tried 
doing to him. She handed him a five-dollar 
bill from the 
billfold in her pocket 
and set up the pieces 
again, 
this time 
taking the black ones for herself. 
There were four other 
players standing 
nearby now, watching 
them. 
She tried the Sicilian against his 
pawn to king four, but 
he wiped it away with a pawn gambit and got her into an 
irregular opening. He was incredibly 
fast. She had him in 
trouble 
at midgame with doubled 
rooks on an open file, 
but he ignored 
them and attacked 
down the center, letting 
her check him twice with the rooks, exposing 
his king. But 

2 1 9 

WALTER TEVIS 

when she tried to bring a knight 
into it for 
mate, he sprang 
loose and was at her queen 
and then her king, catching 
her 
finally 
in a mating net. She resigned 
before he could. move 
in for the kil l . She gave him a ten this time and he gave 
her the 
five back. She had sixty dollars in her pocket and 
more money back at the 
room. 
By noon there were forty or 
more people watching. 
Most of the players from the tournament 
were there along 
with some 
of the spectators 
who regularly attended 
the 
games, college 
students 
and a group of men who might 
have been professors. She and Benny kept playing, 
not 
even talking 
now between 
games. Beth won the third one 
with a beautiful 
save ju
st before her flag dropped, but she 
lost the next four and drew the 
fifth. Some of 
the positions 
were brilliantly 
complex, but there was no time for analyÂ­
sis. It was thrilling but frustrating. She had never in her 
life been beaten so consistently, 
and although 
it was only 
five-minute 
chess and not serious, it was an immersion 
in 
quiet humiliation. 
She had never felt like this 
before. She 
played beautif
ully, followed 
the game 
with precision 
and 
responded 
accurately 
to every threat, 
mounted powerful 
threats 
of her own, but it meant nothing. Benny seemed to 
have some resource 
beyond her understanding, 
and he won 
game after game from her. She felt helpless, 
and inside 
her 
there grew a quiet sense of outrage. 
Finally 
she gave him her last five dollars. It was fiveÂ­
thirty 
in the afternoon. A row of empty Styrofoam 
cups sat 
by the board. When she got up to leave, 
there was apÂ­
plause 
and Benny shook her hand
. She wanted to hit him 
but said nothing. There was random applause 
from the 
crowd in the room. 
As she was leaving
, the man she had played 
the first 
of 

220 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

the week, Phillip 
Resnais, stopped 
her. "I wouldn't worry 
about it, " he said. " Benny plays speed chess as well as 
anyone in the world. It doesn't really 
mean a lot." 
She nodded curtly 
and thanked 
him. When she went 
outside into the 
late-afternoon sunlight, 
she felt like a fool. 
That night she stayed 
in her room 
and took tranquilizers. 
Four of them. 
She felt rested 
in the morning, 
but stupid. 
Mrs. Wheatley 
had once described 
things 
as looking 
askew; that was how 
they looked to 
Beth when she awoke from her deep, 
tranquilized sleep. 
But she no longer 
felt the humiliation 
she had 
felt after being beaten by Benny. She took her pill 
bottle 
from the bedstand 
drawer and squeezed 
the top on it 
tight. It would 
not do to take any more. Not until the 
tournament 
was over. 
She thought 
suddenly 
of Thursday, 
the day she 
would play Benny, and she tensed. But she put 
the pills back in the drawer and got 
dressed. She ate 
breakfast 
early and drank three cups of strong 
coffee with 
it. Then she took a brisk walk around the main part of the 
campus, playing 
through 
one of the games 
from Benny 
Watts' s book. He 
was brilliant, 
she told herself, 
but not 
unbeatable. Anyway, she wouldn't play him for three 
more days. 
The games started 
at one and 
went on until 
four or five 
in the afternoon. Adjournments 
were finished 
either 
in the 
evening 
or the morning 
of the next day. By noon 
her head 
was clear and when she started 
her one o'clock 
game 
against 
a tall, silent 
Californian 
in a Black Power T-shirt, 
she was ready for him. Although 
he wore his hair in a kind 
of Afro, he was white-as all of 
them were. She answered 
his English Opening 
with both knights, 
making it a fourÂ­
knights game, and decided 
against 
her normal practice 
to 

221 

WALTER TEVIS 

trade him down to an endgame. It worked beautif
ully, and 
she was pleased 
with her handling 
of the pawns; she had 
one on the sixth and one 
on the seventh 
rank when 
he 
resigned. It was easier 
than she had 
expected; 
her endgame 
study with 
Beltik 
had paid off. 
That evening 
Benny Watts joined her at 
the cafeteria 
table while she was eating her 
dessert. 
" Beth , " he said, 
"it's 
going to be you or me. " 
She looked up from her rice pudding. 
" Are you trying 
to psych me 
out?'' 
He laughed. 
"No. I can beat you without 
that." 
She went 
on eating and said 
nothing. 
"Look, " he said, "I'm sorry about yesterday
. I wasn' t 
trying 
t o hustle 
you . " 
She took a sip of 
coffee. "You weren't?" 
" I j ust wanted some action. " 
"And money, " Beth said. Although 
that wasn't the 
point. 
" You're the best player 
here , " he said. "I've been 
reading your 
games. You attack 
like Alekhine
. " 
" You held me off well enough yesterday
. " 
"That doesn
' t count. 
I know speed chess better 
than you. 
I play a lot of it in New York . " 
" You beat me in Las Vegas. " 
"That was a long time ago. You were too wrapped 
up 
in doubling 
my pawns. I couldn't get away with that 
again. " 
She finished 
her coffee in silence while he ate his dinner 
and drank his milk. When he had finished, 
she said, "Do 
you go over games 
in your head 
when you ' re alone? I 
mean, play all 
the way 
through 
them?" 
He smiled. 
"Doesn' t everybody?" 

222 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT

She permitted 
herself 
to watch television 
in the lounge of 
the Student Union Building that 
evening. Benny wasn't 
there, although 
a few of the other players were. She went 
back to her room 
afterward, feeling lonely. It was her first 
tournament since Mrs. 
Wheatley 
died, and she missed her 
now. She took the endgame book from the collection on 
the desk and began 
studying. Benny was all right. It 
had 
been nice 
of him to talk to her that way. And she 
had 
gotten 
used to his hair by now; she 
liked it long, the way it 
was. He had really 
very good-looking 
hair. 
She won Tuesday' s game, and Wednesday's. Benny 
was still 
playing when 
she finished on 
Wednesday 
and she 
walked over to his table and saw 
in a moment that he had 
it all but won. He looked up at her and smiled. Then he 
made the word silently 
with his 
mouth: ' 'Tomorrow. ' ' 
There was a children's playground 
at the edge of 
the 
campus. She walked to it by moonlight 
and sat on one of 
the swings. What she really wanted was a drink, but that 
was out of the 
question. 
A bottle 
of red wine, with a little 
cheese. 
Then a few pills 
and off to 
bed. But she couldn't. 
She had to be clear in the morning, 
had to be ready for the 
game against 
Benny Watts at one o'clock. Maybe she 
could take one pill and go to bed. Or two. She would take 
two. She swung herself back and 
forth a few times, listenÂ­
ing to the squeaking 
of the chain that held the 
swing, 
before heading 
purposively 
back to the 
dormitory
. She 
took the 
two pills, but it still 
was over an hour before she 
could sleep. 

Something in the deferential 
manner of the tournament 
directors 
and the way the other players 
looked at her told 

223 

WALTER TEVIS 

her that the attention 
of the tournament 
had focused on this 
game. She and Benny were the only players who had come 
this far without even 
a draw. In a round robin there 
was no 
precedence 
of boards; they would play at 
the third table in 
the row that began at the classroom 
door. But attention 
was centered on 
that table, 
and the spectators
, who had 
already 
filled the seats and now included 
a dozen 
people 
standin
g, all became 
quiet as she seated 
herself. 
Benny 
came in a minute after she did; there was whispering 
when 
he arrived at the table and sat down. She looked over at 
the crowd, and a thought 
that had been present 
in her mind 
suddenly 
solidified 
itself: 
the two 
of them were the best 
players in America. 
Benny was wearing 
his faded denim shirt with a silver 
medallion 
on a chain. His sleeves were rolled 
up like a 
laborer's . He was not smiling, 
and he looked a good deal 
older than twenty-f
our. He glanced briefly at the crowd, 
nodded almost imperceptibly 
to Beth, and stared 
at the 
board as the tournament 
director 
signaled 
for the games to 
begin. Benny was playing 
the white pieces. Beth punched 
his clock. 
He played pawn to 
king four, and she 
did not hesitate; 
she replied with 
pawn to queen bishop four: the Sicilian. 
He brought 
out the king knight, and 
she played pawn to 
king three. There was no point in using an obscure 
openÂ­
ing against 
Benny. He knew openings 
better 
than she. The 
place to get him 
would be 
in the middle game, if she could 
mount an attack 
before he did. But first 
she would have 
to 
get equality
. 
She felt a sensation 
she had felt only once before, in 
Mexico City pla
ying Borgov: 
she felt like 
a child trying 
to 
outsmart an adult. 
When she 
made her second move, she 

224 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

looked across 
the board at Benny and saw 
the quiet seriÂ­
ousness 
of his face and felt unready for this game with 
him. But it wasn't so . She knew in part of 
herself 
that it 
wasn't, that in Mexico City she had 
overwhelmed 
a string 
of professionals 
before wilting 
in the game with Borgov, 
that she had 
beaten grandmaster 
after grandmaster 
in this 
tournament, 
that even when she had been playing the 
janitor 
at Methuen 
Home as an eight-year-old 
she had played 
with 
a solidity 
that was altogether 
remarkable, 
altogether 
proÂ­
fessional
. Yet she felt now, however 
illogically, 
inexperiÂ­
enced. 
Benny thought 
for several 
minutes 
and made an unusual 
move. Instead 
of playing 
the queen pawn, he pushed the 
queen bishop 
pawn to the fourth 
rank. It sat there, 
facing 
her queen bishop 
pawn, unsupported
. She looked 
at it for a 
minute, 
wondering 
what he had in mind. He might be 
going for the Mar6czy 
Bind, but doing it out of the normal 
sequence. It was new-something 
probably 
planned 
espeÂ­
cially 
for this game. She suddenly 
feit embarrassed, 
aware 
that although 
she had gone through 
Benny' s game book, 
she had 
prepared 
nothing 
special 
for today and had apÂ­
proached 
it as she 
always approached 
chess, 
ready to play 
by intuition 
and attack. 
And then she began to 
see that 
there was nothing 
sinister 
about Benny' s move, nothing 
she could not handle. It 
became clear to her 
that she did not 
have to play into it. 
She could decline 
the invitat
ion. If she played her knight 
to queen bishop 
three, 
his move might be wasted. 
Maybe 
he was only fishing 
for a quick advantage-as though 
playing 
speed chess. She brought 
her knight 
out. What the 
hell, 
as Alma Wheatley 
would say. 
Benny played pawn to queen four; she took the 
pawn, 

225 

WALTER TEVIS 

and he retook with his knight. 
She brought 
out the other 
knight 
and waited for him to bring out his. She would pin 
it when he did' and then take it, 
getting 
doubled 
pawns. 
That queen bishop 
pawn move of his was 
costing 
him, and 
although 
the advantage 
wasn't much, it was certain . 
But he did not bring out the knight. 
Instead 
he took 
hers. Clearly 
he didn't want the doubled 
pawn. She let that 
sink in a moment before retaking
. It was astounding; 
he 
was already 
on the defensive. A few 
minutes 
before, she 
had felt like an amateur, 
and here Benny Watts had 
tried to 
confuse 
her on the third move and had 
put himself 
in 
trouble. 
The obvious thing 
was to take his knight 
with her 
knight 
pawn, capturing toward 
the center. 
If she took the other 
way, with her queen pawn, he would trade queens. 
That 
would prevent 
her from castling 
and would deny her the 
queen she loved for quick 
attack. She reached 
her hand out 
to take the knight 
with the knight 
pawn and then brought 
it 
back. Somehow the idea of opening 
the queen file, shockÂ­
ing though it was, looked attractive. 
She began to study it. 
And gradually 
it began to make sense. 
With an early queen 
trade, castling 
would be irrelevant. 
She could bring the 
king out 
the way 
you did in the endgame. She looked 
across 
at Benny again and saw that he was wondering 
why 
she was taking 
so long with this routine 
recaptur
e. SomeÂ­
how he looked smaller 
to her. What the hell, she thought 
again and took with 
the queen pawn, exposing 
her queen. 
Benny did 
not hesitate; 
he took 
her queen with his and 
punched 
the clock smartly. He did 
not even say ' 'Check .' ' 
She took with her king as she 
had to, and he pushed up the 
other bishop pawn to protect 
his king 
pawn. It was a 
simple 
defensive 
move, but something 
in her 
exulted 
when 

226 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

he did 
it. She felt naked with no queen this early in the 
game, yet 
she was beginning 
to feel strong 
without it. 
She 
already 
had the initiative, 
and she knew 
it. She pushed her 
pawn to king four. It was not an obvious move at this 
stage, and the 
soundness 
of it warmed her. It opened up 
the diagonal 
for her queen 
bishop 
and held his king pawn 
to the fourth rank . 
She looked up from the board and 
around her. All the other games were intently 
in progress; 
the spectators 
were hushed, 
watching. There were more 
people standing, and they were standing 
where they could 
see the game she was playing with 
Benny. The director 
came by and made the move on the display 
board in front 
of their table, pushing 
the king pawn to king four. The 
spectators began to 
take that in. She looked to the other 
side of the room and out the window. It was a beautiful 
day, with fresh leaves 
on the trees and an impeccably 
blue 
sky. She felt herself 
expand, 
relax, 
open up. She was 
going to beat him. 
She was 
going to beat him soundly. 
The continuation 
she found on the nineteenth 
move was 
a beautiful 
and subtle 
wonder. 
It sprang to her mind 
full-blown, with half a dozen moves 
as clear as if they 
were projected 
on a screen 
in front of her, her 
rook, bishop 
and knight 
dancing 
together down 
in his 
king' 
s comer of 
the board. Yet there was no checkmate 
in it 
or even an 
advantage 
in material. After her knight 
came to queen five 
on the twenty-f
ifth move and Benny was forced merely to 
push a pawn because 
he could do nothing 
to defend, she 
traded 
rook and knight 
for rook and knight 
and brought 
her 
king to queen three. Although 
the pieces 
and pawns were 
equal, it was only a matter of counting moves
. It would 
take twelve 
for him to get 
a pawn to the eighth 
rank and 
queen it, while she could do it in ten. 

227 

WALTER TEVIS 

Benny made a few moves, bringing 
his king out 
in the 
hopeless 
attempt 
to take off her pawns before she took 
away his, but even his arm 
as it moved the king was 
listle
ss. And when she took his queen bishop pawn, he 
reached out 
and toppled 
his king. There 
was silence 
and 
then quiet applause. She had won 
in thirty moves. 
As they were 
leaving 
the room Benny said to her, ' 'I 
never thought 
you'd let me trade queens." 
" I didn' t either," she said._ 

228 

CHAPTER 1 1 

After the ceremony 
Saturday evening, Benny took her 
to a 
bar in town. They sat in a back 
booth and Beth drank her 
first beer and ordered 
another. 
They both tasted 
delicious. 
"Easy, " Benny said. " Easy. " He had not finished 
his 
first. 
" You're right, " she said and slowed down. She felt 
high enough already. No losses. No draws. Her last two 
opponents 
had offered 
draws in 
midgame, 
and she had 
refused. 
" A perfect 
score , " Benny said. 
" It feels good, " she said, meaning 
the victory, 
but the 
beer felt good too. 
She looked at him more closely. 
" I 
appreciate 
the way 
you're taking 
it. " 
" A mask, " he said. " I ' m raging 
inwardly." 
" It doesn't show. " 
â¢ ' I should 
not have played 
that goddamned bishop 
pawn.' ' 

229 

WALTER TEVIS 

They sat silently for 
a while. He took a thoughtful sip of 
beer and asked, "What are you going to do about Borgov?" 
" When I go to Paris? 
I don' t even have a passport
. " 
" When you go to Moscow. " 
" I don' t know what you're talking 
about. " 
" Don ' t they deliver 
the mail in Kentucky?" 
"Of course 
they do. " 
"The Moscow 
Invitati
onal. The U . S . winner is invited." 
"I want another 
beer , " she said. 
" You didn' t know that?" 
Benny looked shocked. 
" I ' ll get the beer myself." 
"Go ahead. " 
She went up to the bar and ordered 
another 
bottle. 
She 
had heard of the Moscow Invitational 
but knew nothing 
about it. The bartender brought 
her the beer, and she told 
him to get another. 
When she came back to the table, 
Benny said, "That's too much beer. " 
"Probably." She waited 
for the foam to settle 
and took 
a swallow. ' 'How do I get to Moscow if I go? ' ' 
" When I went, the Federation 
bought m y ticket 
and a 
church group put 
up the rest.' ' 
" Did you have a second?" 
"Barnes . " 
"Barnes? " She stared 
at him. 
" It would be tough to be in Russia 
alone . " He frowned. 
" You shouldn't drink beer like that. You'll be washed up 
at twenty-one
. " 
She set 
down the glass. " Who else will be playing 
in 
Moscow?'' 
"Four other countries and 
the four top Russians." 
That would mean Luchenko 
and B orgov. Possibly 
Shapkin. 
She did not want to 
think about it. She looked at 

230 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

him quietly 
for a minute. 
" Benny, I like the way your hair 
looks. " 
He stared 
at her. "Sure you do, " he said. "What about 
Russia?' ' 
She took another 
drink of beer. She did like Benny' s 
hair and his blue eyes. She had never 
thought 
o f him 
sexually 
before, but she was thinking 
that way 
now . "Four 
Russian 
chess players, " she said, "is a lot of Russian 
chess players. " 
"Murderous
. " He raised 
his glass and finished 
off his 
beer. He had drunk only the 
one. "Beth , " he said, "you're 
the only American 
I know who might do it.' ' 
"I went to pieces 
with Borgov in Mexico City . 
"When do you go to Paris?" Benny said. 
"In five weeks. " 
"Then get your life organized 
around that and study. 
Get a trainer.' ' 
" What about you?" 
He thought 
a moment. 
"Can you come to New York?" 
"I don't know . " 
' 'You can sleep i n my living 
room, and leave for Paris 
from there. " 
The idea shocked her. 
"I've got a 
house to take care of, 
in Kentucky
. ' ' 
"Let the fucking house fall down. " 
' 'I'm not ready . . . 
' 'When will you be? Next year? Ten 
years?'' 
"I don' t know. " 
He leaned 
forward and said slowly, "If you don' t do it, 
you'll drink your talent 
away. It' l l go down the drain. " 
"Borgov made 
me look like 
a fool. " 

" 

"You weren' t ready." 

231 

WALTER TEVIS 

"I don't know how good I really 
am. " 
"/know, " he said. " You're the best there is. " 
She took a deep breath. "All right. 
I'll come to New 
York . " 
" You can come with me from here , " he said. "I'll 
drive us. " 
"When?" This was happening 
too fast. She felt frightened
. 
"Tomorrow afternoon, when 
everything her
e's finished. 
Whenever 
we can get away . " He stood up. 
"And about 
sex . . . 
She looked up at him. 
"Forget it," he said. 

' ' 

" Spring, " Benny said, "is first class. Absolutely 
first 
class . ' ' 
"How can you tell?" Beth asked. They were 
driving 
along a gray asphalt 
section 
of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, 
pounding 
along the gritty road 
with semis and dusty pasÂ­
senger 
cars. 
"It's 
out there somewhere
. Up in the hills. It's even in 
New York ." 
" Ohio was pleasant
, " Beth said. But she didn't like this 
discussion
. Weather 
did not interest her. She had made no 
arrangements 
for the house in Lexington, 
had not been 
able to get the 
lawyer on the telephone 
and did not know 
what to expect in New York. She 
did not 
like Benny's 
insouciance 
in the face of her uncertai
nty, the kind of 
sunny blankness 
that suffused his face from 
time to time. 
He had looked that way during the awards ceremony 
and 
during the time she did her interviews 
and signed auÂ­
tographs 
and thanked 
the officials 
and the USCF people 
who had come down from upstate New York to talk about 

232 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

the importance 
of chess. His face was blank now. She 
turned her eyes to the 
road . 
After a while he spoke up. " When you go to Russia 
I 
want to go with you ." 
That was a surprise. They hadn' t talked 
about Russia, or 
chess, 
since getting 
in the car. "As my second?" 
"Whatever. 
I can't afford to pay expenses
. " 
" You want me to pay them?" 
"Something 
will tum up. While you were interviewed 
by that magazine, I talked 
to Johanssen
. He said there 
wouldn't be any Federation 
money for seconds. " 
"I'm only thinking 
about Paris, " she 
said. " I haven't 
decided 
to go to 
Moscow yet. " 
" You' ll go. " 
" I don' t even know if I ' m going to stay more than a few 
days with you. I have to get a passport." 
"We can do that 
in New York . " 
She started 
to say something 
but didn't. She looked at 
Benny. Now that blankness 
had left his face, she felt 
warmer toward him. She had 
made love to 
two men in her 
life, and it was hardly 
making love; if she 
and Benny went 
to bed together, 
there would 
be more to it. She would see 
there was more to it. They would be 
in hiï¿½ 
apartment 
by 
midnight; 
maybe something 
would happen there. 
Maybe 
he would feel differently 
at home. 
"Let' s play chess, " Benny 
said. "I'll 
be White. Pawn 
to king four. 
' ' 
She shrugged. 
"Pawn to queen bishop 
four. " 
" N , " he said, using the letter 
for "knight. " "K-B3. " 
"Pawn to queen three. " She wasn' t sure she liked this. 
She had never shared her interior 
chessboa
rd before, and 
there was 
a sense of violation 
in opening 
it to Benny' s 
moves. 

233 

WALTER TEVIS 

" P to Q four, " Benny said. 
" Pawn takes pawn. " 
" Knight takes. " 
"Knight. 
King bishop 
three. " Actually 
it was easy. She 
could look at the road ahead and at the same 
time see the 
imaginary chessboard 
and the 
pieces 
on it without 
difficulty. 
"N to Q-B3, " Benny said. 
" Pawn to king ' s knight 
three. " 
" P to B four. " 
" P to B four. " 
"The Levenfish, " Benny said dryly. " I never liked it. " 
' 'Play your knight.' ' 
Suddenly 
his voice was like ice. "Don't tell me what to 
move, " he said. She pulled 
back as if stung. 
They drove in silence 
for a few miles. Beth watched 
the 
gray steel divider 
that separated them 
from the oncoming 
lanes. Then, as they were coming 
to a tunnel, Benny said, 
" You were right about the knight on B-3 . I'll put it 
there.' ' 
She hesitated 
a moment before speaking. " Okay. I'll 
take the knight. 
" 
"Pawn takes, " Benny said. 
"Pawn to king five. " 
"Pawn takes again, " Benny said. " Do you know what 
Scharz says about that 
one? The footnote?" 
"I don't read footnot
es, " Beth said. 
"It's 
time you 
started
. " 
" I don' t like Scharz." 
" I don't either, " Benny said. " But I read him. What's 
your move?' ' 
" Queen takes queen. Check ." She could hear the sulÂ­
lenness 
in her voice. 

234 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

"King takes, " Benny said, relaxing 
now at the wheel. 
Pennsylvania 
rolled 
by. Beth forced him to resign 
on the 
twenty-seventh 
move and felt somewhat 
better for it. She 
had always liked the Sicilian. 

There were plastic 
bags full of garbage 
in the entryway 
to 
Benny' s apartment 
and the light 
overhead 
was only a dirty 
bare bulb. It was a white tile hallway and as depressing 
at 
midnight 
as the toilet 
in a bus station
. There were three 
locks on Benny' s front door, which 
was painted 
red and 
had some impenetrable 
word like ' 'Bezbo' ' written 
on it in 
black spray paint. 
Inside was 
a small and cluttered living 
room with books 
piled everywhere
. But the lighting 
was pleasant 
when he 
got the 
lamps on. One end of the room 
was a kitchen, and 
near it was a door going off to the bedroom . There was a 
grass rug and 
no sofa and chairs-just black pillows 
to sit 
on with lamps beside 
them. 
The bathroom 
was orthodox 
enough, with a floor made 
of black-and-white 
tile and a broken handle on the hotÂ­
water tap. There was a tub and 
shower with a black plastic 
curtain . She washed her hands and face and came back 
into the living 
room. Benny had gone into the bedroom 
to 
unpack. 
Her bag was still 
on the living-room floor next to 
a bookcase. 
She walked over to it and looked wearily at 
the books. They were all on chess-all 
five shelves 
of 
them. Some were in Russian 
and German, but they 
were 
all on chess. 
She walked across 
the hard little 
rug to the 
other side of the room where there was another 
bookcase, 
this one 
made of boards resting 
on bricks. More chess. 
One whole shelf was Shakhmatni 
going back 
to 
the nineteen-fifties.

"There's room in this closet, " Benny shouted 
from the 
bedroom. " You can hang up when you want to. " 
"Okay , " she said. Back on the turnpike 
she had thought 
they might make love when they got here. Now she wanted 
only to sleep. And what was she supposed 
to sleep on? 
" I 
thought 
I was going t o get a sofa,' ' she said. 
He came into the doorway. " I said 'living room . ' " He 
went back to 
the bedroom and returned with a bulkyÂ­
looking 
thing and some kind of 
pump. He flipped 
it out in 
the middle of the floor and 
began pedaling 
the pump with 
his foot, and after a while it puffed up and became an air 
mattress. "I'll get sheets, " Benny said. He brought them 
out of the bedroom. 
"I'll do it," she said and took them from him. She 
didn't like the looks of the mattress, but she knew where 
her pills 
were. She could 
get them out after he fell asleep, 
if she 
needed to. There would be nothing 
to drink in this 
apartment. 
Benny had not said so, but she knew. 
She must have 
fallen 
asleep before 
Benny did, since she 
forgot about the pills in her luggage. 
She awoke to the 
sound of a klaxon outside-an ambulance 
or fire truck. 
When she 
tried to sit up she could not; there was no edge 
of the bed 
to hang her legs over. She pushed herself 
up 
and stood, 
wearing 
pajamas, and looked around. Benny 
was standing 
at the sink counter with his 
back to her. She 
knew where she was, but it looked different by daylight. 
The siren 
faded and was replaced 
by the general 
traffic 
sounds of New York. One blind was open and 
she could 
see the cab of a big truck as close as Benny was, and 
beyond it taxis weaving 
past. A dog barked intermittently. 
Benny turned and came over to her. He was holding out 
a big cardboar
d cup to 
her. 

236 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

"Chock Full 0' Nuts, " the cup read. Something 
seemed 
very strange 
about this. No one had ever given her anyï¿½ 
thing in the morning-certainly 
not Mrs. Wheatley, who 
was never up before Beth had eaten 
her breakfast. She 
took the plastic 
top off and tasted 
the coffee . "Thanks, " 
she said. 
" Dress in the 
bedroom, " Benny said. 
"I need a shower. " 
"It's 
all yours . " 

Benny had set up a folding card table with a green and 
beige chessboard on it. He was arranging 
the pieces 
when 
she came into 
the living 
room. " Okay , " he said
, "we'll 
start with these.' ' He handed her a roll of pamphlets 
and 
magazines 
wrapped with a rubber band. On top was 
a 
small pamphlet 
with a cheap paper cover 
reading 
' 'The 
Hastings 
Christmas 
Chess Congress-Falaise 
Hall, White 
Rock Gardens, " and under this, "A Record of Games. " 
The pages inside 
were dense with type, smudgily 
printed
. 
There were two chess games on a page, with boldface 
captions: 
Luchenko-
Uhlmann; 
Borgov-Penr
ose. He handed 
her another, 
titled 
simply 
Chess. It was much 
like the Hastings 
booklet. 
Three of the 
magazines 
were 
from Germany, and one 
was from Russia. 
' ' We' II play through 
the Hastings 
games, ' ' Benny said. 
He went into the bedroom and came back with two plain 
wooden chairs, 
setting 
one on each side of 
the card table 
near the front window. 
The truck was still 
parked outside 
and the 
street 
was full of slow-moving 
cars. " You play the 
white pieces 
and I 'll play B lack .' ' 
" I haven't had breakfast 
. . . " 
" Eggs in the fridge, " Benny said. " We'll play 
the 
Borgov games first.' ' 

Grandmaster 

237 

WALTER TEVIS 

" All of them?" 
"He' II be in Paris when you go . " 
She looked 
at the magazine 
in her hand and then over 
at 
the table by the window again, then at her watch. It was 
ten after eight. 
"I'll 
have the eggs first, " she said
. 
They got sandwiches 
from a deli 
for lunch and ate them 
over the board. Supper came from a Chinese 
takeout on 
First A venue. 
Benny would 
not let her 
play quickly 
through 
the openings; 
he stopped 
her whenever 
a move was at all 
obscure and asked her why she did it. He made her 
analyze 
everything 
out of the ordinary. Sometimes he 
would physically 
stop her hand 
from moving a piece to ask 
questions. "Why not advance 
the knight?" 
or " Why isn't 
he defending 
against 
the rook?" or "What's going to 
become of the backward pawn?'' It was rigorous 
and 
intense, and he did not let up. She had been 
aware of such 
questions for years 
but had 
never allowed 
herself 
to pursue 
them with this kind of rigor. 
Often her mind would be 
racing 
with the attack possibilities inherent 
in the positions 
that developed 
in front of her, 
wanting 
to push Luchenko 
or Mecking or Czerniak 
into lightning 
attacks 
against 
Borgov, 
when Benny stopped 
her with 
a question 
about 
defense or opening 
the light or dark squares 
or contesting 
a 
file with a 
rook. It infuriated 
her sometimes, yet she 
could 
see the rightness 
of his 
questio
ns. She had been playing 
grandmast
er games in her head from the time she first 
discovered 
but she had 
not been disciplined 
about it. She played 
them to exult in the win-to feel the 
stab of excitement 
at a sacrifice 
or a forced mate, espeÂ­
cially 
in the games that were printed 
in books precisely 
because 
they incorporated 
drama of that kind-like 
the 
game books by Fred Reinfeld that were full of queen 

Chess Review, 

238 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

sacrifices 
and melodrama. 
She knew from her tournament 
experience 
that you couldn' t rely on your opponent 
setting 
himself 
up for a queen sacrifice 
or a surprise 
mate with 
knight 
and rook; still, she treasured the 
thrill 
of games like 
that. It was what she loved in Morphy, not his routine 
games and certainly not his lost ones-and 
Morphy like 
everyone 
else had lost games. But she had always been 
bored by ordinary chess even when 
it was played by 
grandmasters
, bored in the way that she was bored by 
Reuben Fine's endgame analyses 
and the counteranalyses 
in places like 
Chess Review that pointed 
out errors in 
Reuben Fine. She had never done anything 
like what 
Benny was making her do now. 
The games she was playing 
were serious , workmanlike 
chess played by the best players in the world, and the 
amount of mental energy latent 
in each move was staggerÂ­
ing. Yet the results 
were often monumentally 
dull and 
inconclusive
. An enormous 
power of thought might 
be 
implicit 
in a single 
white pawn move, say, opening 
up a 
long-range 
threat 
that could become manifest only in half a 
dozen moves; but Black would foresee the threat 
and find 
the move that canceled 
it out, and the brilliancy 
would be 
aborted. It was frustrating 
and anticlimactic
, yet-because 
Benny forced her to stop and see what was going onÂ­
fascinating. 
They kept it up for six days, leaving 
the 
apartment 
only when necessary 
and once, on Wednesday 
night, 
going to a movie. Benny did not 
own a TV, or a 
stereo; his apartment 
was for eating, 
sleeping 
and chess. 
They played 
through 
the Hastings 
booklet 
and the 
Russian 
one, not missing 
a game except 
for the grandmaster dra
ws. 
On Tuesday she 
got her lawyer in Kentucky 
on the phone 
and asked him 
to see if everything 
was all right 
at the 

239 

WALTER TEVIS 

house. 
She went to Benny's branch of Chemical 
Bank and 
opened an account 
with the winner's check from Ohio. It 
would take five days for it to clear. 
She had enough 
traveler's 
checks to pay her 
share of the expenses 
until 
then. 
They did remarkably 
little 
talking 
during 
the first 
week. 
Nothing sexual 
happened
. Beth had not forgotten 
about it, 
but she was too 
busy going over chess games. When they 
finished, 
sometimes at 
midnight, 
she would sit for 
a while 
on a pillow 
on the floor or take a 
walk to Second or Third 
Avenue and get an ice cream or a Hershey 
bar at a deli. 
She went into none 
of the bars, and she seldom stayed 
out 
long. New York could be grim and dangerous-looking 
at 
night, 
but that wasn't the reason. She was 
too tired to do 
more than go back to the apartment, pump up her mattress 
and go to sleep. 
Sometimes 
being with Benny was like being with no 
one at all . For hours 
at a time he 
would be completely 
impersonal
. Something 
in her responded 
to that, and she 
became impersonal 
and cool herself, 
communicating 
nothÂ­
ing but 
chess. 
But sometimes 
it would change. 
Once when she 
was 
studying 
an especially 
complex 
position 
between 
two RusÂ­
sians, a position 
that ended in a draw, she saw somet
hing, 
followed it, and cried 
out, "Look at this, Benny! " and 
started moving the pieces 
around. "He missed one. Black 
has this with the knight 
. . . 
' ' and she showed a way for 
the black player to win. And Benny, smiling 
broadly, 
came over to where she was sitting 
at the board and 
hugged her around the shoulders . 
Most of the time, chess was the only language 
between 
them. One afternoon when they had spent three or four 

240 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

hours on endgame analysis 
she said wearily, " Don' t you 
get bored sometimes?" and he looked at her blankly. 
" What else is there?" he said. 

They were doing rook and pawn endings 
when there was a 
knock at the door. Benny 
got up and opened it, and there 
were three people. One was a woman. Beth 
recognized 
one man from a Chess Review 
piece about him a few 
months before and the other looked familiar, 
although 
she 
couldn't place him. The woman was strikin
g . She was 
about twenty-f
ive, with black hair and 
a pale complexion
, 
and she was wearing a 
very short gray skirt and some kind 
of military shirt with 
epaulets
. 
"This is Beth Harmon, " Benny said. " Hilton Wexler, 
Grandmaster Arthur 
Levertov , and Jenny Baynes. " 
"Our new champ, " Levertov 
said, giving 
her a little 
bow . He was in his 
thirties 
and balding. 
"Hi," Beth said. 
She stood up from the table. 
"Congratulat
ions! " Wexler said. " Benny needed a les-
son in humilit
y . ' ' 
"I'm already 
tops in humility
, " Benny said. 
The woman held out her hand. "Nice to meet you . " 
It felt strange 
to Beth to have 
all these people in BenÂ­
ny' s small living 
room. It seemed as though she had lived 
half her life in this apartment 
with him, studying 
chess 
games, and it 
was outrageous 
for anyone else to be there. 
She had been in New York nine days. Not knowing 
exÂ­
actly what to do, she sat down at the board again. Wexler 
came over 
and stood at the other side. 
" Do you do 
problems? ' ' 
" No . " She had tried a few as a child, but they did not 
interest 
her. The positions did 
not look natural. White to 

241 

WALTER TEVIS 

move and mate in two. It was, as Mrs. Wheatley 
would 
have said, irrelevant. 
"Let me show you one , " Wexler said. His voice was 
friendly 
and easy. "Can I mess this 
up?" 
"Go ahead. " 
"Hilton, " Jenny said, coming over to them, "she ' s not 
one of your problem 
freaks . She's the U . S . Champion. " 
" It's okay, " Beth said. But she was glad of what 
Jenny 
had said. 
Wexler put pieces 
on the 
board until there was a weirdÂ­
looking 
position 
with both 
queens in corners and all four 
rooks on the same file. The kings were nearly 
centered, 
which would be unlikely 
in a real game. When he finÂ­
ished, he folded his arms 
across his chest. 
"This is my 
favorite, " he said. "White wins 
it in 
three. " 
Beth looked at it, annoyed. 
It seemed silly 
to deal with 
something 
like this. It could never come up in a game. 
Advance the 
pawn, check with the knight, 
and the king 
moved to the corner. But then the pawn 
queened, 
and it 
was stalemate
. Maybe the 
pawn knighted, 
to make the 
next check. That work
ed. Then if the king 
didn't move 
there after the 
first check . . . 
She went back 
to that for a 
moment and saw what to do. It was like a problem 
in 
algebra, and she 
had always been good at algebra. She 
looked up at Wexler. 
"Pawn to queen seven. " 
He looked astonished
. "Jesus , " he said. "That's fast. " 
Jenny was smiling. 
" See, Hilton, " she said. 
Benny had been watching 
all this silently. 
"Let' s do a 
simultane
ous , " he said 
suddenly 
to Beth. "Play us all. " 
"Not me, " Jenny said. " I don't even know the rules . " 
"Do we have 
enough boards and pieces?" 
Beth asked. 
' 'On the shelf in the closet.' ' Benny went into 
the 

242 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

bedroom and returned 
with a cardboard 
box. " We ' ll set 
these up on the floor.' ' 
"Time control
?" Levertov 
said. 
Beth suddenly 
thought 
of something. "Let's do speed 
chess. " 
"It gives us an edge , " Benny said. " We can think on 
your time.' ' 
" I want to try it." 
"No good." Benny' s tone was severe. "You're not 
very good at speed chess anyway. 
Remember?
' ' 
Something 
in her responded 
strongly 
to what he was not 
saying. "I'll bet you ten I beat you . " 
" What if you throw the other games and use all your 
time against 
me?" 
She could have kicked 
him. "I'll 
bet you 
ten on each of 
them, too . " She was surprised 
at the firmness 
in her own 
voice. 
She sounded 
like Mrs. Deardorff. 
Benny shrugged
. "Okay . It' s your money. " 
"Let's put all three boards on the floor. 
I ' ll sit in the 
middle. ' ' 
They did it, using three clocks. Beth had been very 
sharp for the past several 
days, and she played with unhesÂ­
itating 
precision, attacking 
on all 
the boards 
at once. She 
beat the three of them with time 
to spare . 
When it was over, Benny didn't say anything. 
He went 
to the 
bedroom , got his 
billfold , took three tens out of it 
and handed them to Beth. 
"Let's do it again, " Beth said
. There was a bitterness 
in her voice; hearing 
the words, she knew it could have 
meant sex: Let's do 
If this 
was what Benny 
wanted, this was what he would get. She began setting 
up 
the pieces. 

it again. 

243 

WALTER TEVIS 

They got into position 
on the floor, 
and Beth played the 
whites 
on all three 
again. The boards were fanned out in 
front of her so that she didn' t have to spin around to 
play 
them, but she 
found herself 
hardly 
consulting 
them, anyÂ­
way, except to make the moves. She played from chessÂ­
boards in her head. 
Even the 
mechanical 
business 
of making 
the moves and punching 
the clocks 
was effortless. 
Benny's 
position 
was hopeless 
when his clock flag fell; she had 
time left over. 
He gave her 
another 
thirty, and when she 
suggested 
trying 
again he said, "No . " 
There was tension 
i n the room, and n o one knew how to 
deal with it. Jenny tried to laugh about it, saying, "It's 
just male chauvini
sm, " but it didn' t help. Beth was furiÂ­
ous with 
Benny-furious at him for being easy to beat and 
furious 
with the way he was taking it, trying 
to look 
unmoved, 
as though nothing 
affected him. 
Then Benny did something 
surprising. He had been 
sitting 
with his back straight
. Suddenly 
he leaned against 
the wall, pushing 
his legs 
out on the floor, 
relaxing. 
" Well, kid , " he said, "I think 
you' ve got it. " And everyÂ­
body laughed. 
Beth looked 
at Jenny, 
who was sitting 
on 
the floor 
next to Wexler. 
Jenny, who was beautiful 
and 
intelligent, 
was looking 
at her with admirati
on.

Beth and Benny spent the next few days studying 
s, going back to the nineteen-f
ifties. Every 
now 
and then 
they would play a game, and Beth always won it. 
She could feel herself 
moving past Benny 
in a way that 
was almost 
physical
. It was astounding 
to them both. In 
one game she uncovered an attack 
on his queen 
on the 
thirteenth 
move and had him laying 
down his king on the 
sixteenth. 
" Well, " he said 
softly, "nobody' s done that to 
me in fifteen years.' ' 

244 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

' 'Not even Borgov? ' ' 
"Not even 
Borgov. " 
Sometimes 
chess would 
keep her awake 
at night for 
hours. It was like Methuen, except that she was 
more 
relaxed 
and not afraid of sleeplessness
. She would lie on 
her mattress 
on the 
living-room 
floor after midnight 
with 
New York street 
noises 
coming in through the 
open bay 
window and study positions 
in her mind. They were as 
clear as they had ever been. She did not take tranquiliz
ers, 
and that 
helped the clarity. It was not 
whole games now 
but particular situa
tions-positions 
called ' 'theoretically 
important" 
and "warranting 
close study. " She lay there 
hearing the 
shouts of 
drunks in the street 
outside 
and 
mastered 
the intricacies 
of chess positions 
that were classic 
in their difficulty. 
Once during 
a lovers' quarrel where the 
woman kept shoutin
g, ' 'I'm at my fucking wit' s end. At 
my wit's fucking end ! " and the man kept 
saying, " Like 
your fucking 
sister,' ' Beth lay on her cot and came to see a 
way of queening 
a pawn that she had never seen before. It 
was beautif
ul. It would work. 
She could use 
it. " Up your 
ass, " the woman shouted, 
and Beth lay 
back exulting 
and 
then fell pleasantly asleep. 

They spent their third week repeating 
the Borgov games 
and finished 
the last of them after midnight 
on Thursday. 
When Beth had done her 
analysis 
of the resignat
ion, pointÂ­
ing out how Borgov could avoid 
a draw, she looked up to 
see Benny yawning. 
It was a hot night and the windows 
were open. 
"Shapkin went wrong 
in mid game, " Beth said. " He 
should 
have protected 
his queenside
. ' ' 
Benny looked at her 
sleepily. ' 'Even I get tired of chess 
sometimes
. ' ' 

245 

WALTER TEVIS 

She stood up from the board. "It's 
time for bed . " 
' 'Not s o fast, ' ' Benny said. He looked at her 
for a 
moment and 
smiled. " Do you still 
like my hair?" 
"I've been trying 
to learn how to beat V asily Borgov, " 
Beth said. " Your hair doesn' t enter into it. " 
"I'd like you to come to bed with me. " 
They had been together 
three weeks and she had almost 
forgotten 
sex. "I'm tired," she said, exasperated. 
"So am I . But I'd like you to sleep with me." 
He looked very relaxed 
and pleasant. Suddenly she 
felt 
warm toward him. ' 'All right,' ' she said. 
She was startled 
to wake 
up in the morning with 
someÂ­
one beside 
her in bed. Benny had rolled 
over to his side 
and all she 
could see of him was his pale, bare 
back and 
some of his hair. 
She felt self-conscious 
at first 
and afraid 
of waking him; she sat 
up carefully, leaning 
her back 
against 
the wall . Being in bed 
with a man was really all 
right. 
Making love had 
been all right too, although 
not as 
exciting as she 
had hoped. Benny hadn' t said much. He 
was gentle and easy with her, but there was still 
that 
distance 
of his. She remembered 
a phrase from the first 
man she had 
made love with: ' 'Too cerebral
. ' ' She turned 
toward Benny. His skin did 
look good 
in the light; 
it 
seemed almost 
luminous. For a moment she felt like putÂ­
ting her 
arms around him and hugging 
him with her 
naked 
body, but she restrained 
herself. 
Eventually 
Benny woke, 
rolled 
over on his back and 
blinked at her. 
She had the sheet up, covering 
her breasts. 
After a moment she said, "Good morning. " 
He blinked 
again. " You shouldn' t try the Sicilian 
against 
Borgov, " he said. "He's just too good at it. " 
They spent the morning with two Luchenko 
games; 

246 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

Benny put the emphasis 
on strategy 
rather 
than tactics. He 
was in 
a cheerful 
mood, but Beth felt somehow resentf
ul. 
She wanted something 
more in the way of lovemaking, or 
at least in intimacy, 
and Benny was lecturing 
her. "You're 
a born tactician
, ' ' he said, ' 'but your planning 
is jerryÂ­
built.' ' She said nothing and 
dealt with 
her annoyance 
as 
well as 
she could. 
What he was saying 
was true enough, 
but the 
pleasure he took in pointing 
it out was irritat
ing. 
At noon he 
said, "I've got to get to a poker game. " 
She looked up 
from the position 
she had just analyzed
. 
"A poker game?" 
"I have to 
pay the 
rent. " 
That was astonishing
. She had not thought 
of him as a 
gambler. 
When she asked about it, he said he made more 
money from poker 
and backgammon 
than from chess. 
" You ought to learn, " he said, smiling. 
" You're good at 
games. " 
' 'Then take me with you .' ' 
"This one
's all men . " 
She frowned. "I've heard that said about chess. " 
" I bet you have. You can come along and watch if you 
want to. But you 'II have 
to keep quiet ." 
"How long will it last?" 
"All night, 
maybe. " 
She started to ask him how 
long he had known about 
this game, but didn't. Clearly 
he had known it before last 
night. 
She rode the Fifth A venue bus with him down to 
Forty-fourth 
Street and walked with him over to the AlÂ­
gonquin 
Hotel. Benny seemed to have his mind on someÂ­
thing he wasn't 
interested 
in talking 
about, and they walked 
in silence. 
She was beginning 
to feel angry again; 
she 
hadn' t come to New York for this, and she was annoyed 
at 

247 

WALTER TEVIS 

Benny' s way of offering no explanations 
and no advance 
notice. His 
behavior 
was like his chess game: 
smooth and 
easy on the surface 
but tricky 
and infuriating 
beneath. She 
did not 
like tagging 
along, 
but she did not 
want to go back 
to the apartment 
and study alone. 
The game 
was in a small suite on 
the sixth floor and it 
was, as he had said, all male. Four men were seated 
around a table with coffee cups and chips and cards. An 
air conditioner 
whirred noisily. 
There were two other men 
who seemed merely to be hanging 
around. The players 
looked up when 
Benny came in and greeted 
him jokingly. 
Benny was cool and pleasant. 
"Beth Harmon, " he said, 
and the 
men nodded without 
recognition
. He had gotten 
out his billfold, and now he slipped 
a pile of bills 
from it, 
set them in front of an empty place at the table and sat 
down, ignoring 
Beth. Not knowing 
what her role in all 
this 
was, Beth went into the bedroom , where she had seen 
a 
coffee pitcher 
and cups. She got a cup of 
coffee and went 
back into the other room. Benny had a stack of chips in 
front of him and was 
holding cards 
in his 
hand. The man 
on his left said, "I'll 
bump that, " flatly, and threw a blue 
chip into the center 
of the table. 
The others 
followed 
suit, 
with Benny last. 
She stood at a distance 
from the table watching. She 
Mr. Shaibel, 
remembered 
standing 
in the basement 
watching 
and the intensity 
of her interest in 
what he was doing, 
but 
she felt nothing 
like that 
now. She did not 
care how poker 
was played, even though 
she knew she 
would be good at 
it. She was furi
ous with Benny. He went on playing 
without 
looking 
at her. He handled 
the cards with dexterity 
and tossed chips 
into the center 
of the table with quiet 
aplomb, 
sometimes 
saying things 
like "I'll stay" or "Back 

248 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

Benny's Chess Informants, 

to you .' ' Finally, while one of the men was dealing, 
she 
tapped Benny on the shoulder 
and said softly, "I'm leavÂ­
ing . " He nodded and said " Okay" and turned his attenÂ­
tion back to his cards. Going down 
in the elevator, she felt 
she could have beaten him over the head with a two-byÂ­
four. The cool son of a bitch. 
It was quick sex with her, 
and then off 
to the boys. He had probably planned it that 
way for a week. Tactics 
and strategy. She could have 
killed 
him. 
But the walk across 
town eased her anger, and by the 
time she got on the Third A venue bus 
to go back up to the 
apartment 
on Seventy-eighth 
Street, she was calm. She 
was even pleased 
to be alone for a while. She spent the 
time with 
a new series 
of 
books from Yugoslavia, 
playing 
out games in her head. 
He came in sometime 
during the middle of the night; 
she woke when 
he got into bed. She was glad he was 
back, but she didn't want to make love with him. FortuÂ­
nately 
he wasn't interested either. 
She asked him how he 
had done. "Nearly six hundred, " he said, pleased 
with 
himself. 
She rolled 
over and 
went back to sleep. 
They made love in the morning, 
and she did not enjoy it 
much. She knew she was still 
angry with him for 
the poker 
game-not 
for the game itself 
but for the way he had used 
it just when they had become lovers. 
When they were 
finished, 
he sat up in bed and looked at her for 
a minute. 
" You're pissed 
at me, aren' t you?" 
' 'Yes . ' ' 
"The poker game?" 
"The way you didn't tell me about it. " 
He nodded. "I'm sorry. I do keep my 
distance
. " 
She was relieved 
that he 
had said 
it. " I suppose 
I do 
too," she said. 

249 

WALTER TEVIS 

" I ' ve noticed
. " 
After breakfast 
she suggested 
a game between 
the two 
of them, and he agreed reluctan
tly. They set the clock for 
a half-hour 
each, to keep it brief, 
and she 
proceeded 
to 
beat him handily 
with her Sicilian 
Levenfish, brushing 
aside his threats 
with ease and hounding 
his king merciÂ­
lessly. When it was over he shook his head wryly and 
said, "I needed 
that six hundred. " 
"Maybe so, " she said, "but your timing 
was bad." 
" It doesn't pay to cross you, does 
it?" 
" Do you want to play another?" 
Benny shrugged 
and turned 
away. "Save it for Borgov. " 
But she could see he would have played her if he had 
thought 
he could win. 
She felt a whole lot better. 

They continued 
as lovers 
and did not play any more games, 
except from 
the books. He went out a few days later for 
another poker 
game and came back with two hundred 
in 
winnings 
and they had one of their best times in 
bed 
together, 
with the money beside them on 
the night table. 
She was 
fond of him, but that was all . And by the last 
week before Paris, she was beginning 
to feel that he had 
little 
left to teach her. 

250 

CHAPTER 1 2 

Mrs. Wheatley 
had always carried 
Beth's adoption 
papers 
and birth certificate 
with her when they traveled, and Beth 
had continued the 
practice, though up to now they had 
never been 
needed. During her first week in 
New York, 
Benny took her to 
Rockefeller Center, and she used them 
in applying 
for her passport. Mexico had required only a 
tourist 
card, and Mrs. Wheatley 
had taken care of that. 
The little 
booklet 
with the green cover and her tight-lipped 
picture inside 
came two weeks later. 
Even though she 
wasn't sure of going, 
she had sent the Paris acc
eptance 
in 
a few days before leaving 
Kentucky 
for Ohio. 
When the time came, Benny drove her to 
Kennedy 
Airport 
and dropped 
her off at the Air France terminal. 
"He's not impossible
, " Benny said. " You can beat him . " 
" We'll see , " she said. "Thanks for the help. " She had 
gotten 
her suitcase 
out of 
the car and was 
standing by the 

251 

WALTER TEVIS 

driver's window. 
They were 
in a no-parking 
zone, and he 
could not leave the car to see 
her off. 
"See you next 
week, " Benny said. 
For a moment she wanted to lean in the open 
window 
and kiss him, but she 
restrained 
herself. 
"See you then. " 
She picked up her suitcase 
and went into the terminal. 

This time she was expecting 
to feel the dark hostility 
that 
even seeing him across 
a room could make 
her feel, but 
being prepared 
for it did not stop her from a sharp intake 
of breath. He was standing 
with his back to her, talking 
to 
reporters
. She looked away nervo
usly, as she 
had looked 
away the first 
time at the 
zoo in Mexico City. He was just 
another 
man in a dark suit, another 
Russian 
who played 
chess, 
she told herself. 
One of the men was taking 
his 
picture while the other was talking 
to him. Beth watched 
the three of them for a while, and her tension eased. She 
could beat him. She turned and went to the desk to regisÂ­
ter. Play would start in twenty minutes. 
It was the smallest 
tournament 
she had ever seen
, in this 
elegant 
old building 
near the Ecole Militaire. There were 
six players and five rounds--one round a day for five 
days. If she or 
Borgov lost an early round, they' would still 
have to play each other. The competition 
was strong. Yet, 
strong 
as it was, she did not 
feel either 
of them would be 
beaten by 
anyone else. She walked through 
the doorway 
into the tournament 
room proper, 
feeling no 
anxiety 
about 
the game she would be playing 
this morning 
or about the 
ones over the next 
few days. She would not play Borgov 
until one of the final rounds. She would 
meet a Dutch 
grandmaster 
in ten minutes and 
play Black against 
him, 
but she felt no apprehen
sion. 

252 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

France was not known for its chess, but the room they 
played in was beautif
ul. Two crystal 
chandeliers hung 
from its high blue ceiling
, and the blue flowered carpet 
on 
the floor was thick and rich. There were three tables 
of 
polished 
walnut, 
each with a pink carnation 
in a small vase 
at the side of 
the board. The antique 
chairs 
were upholÂ­
stered 
in blue velvet 
that matched 
the floor and ceiling
. It 
was like an expensive 
restaura
nt, and the tournament 
diÂ­
rectors 
were like well-trained 
waiters 
in tuxedos. Everything 
was quiet and smooth. 
She had flown in from New York 
the night before, had 
seen almost 
nothing 
yet of Paris, but 
she felt at ease here . She had slept well on the plane and 
then slept again in her 
hotel; 
before 
that she had 
put in five 
solid weeks of practice. She had never felt more prepared. 
The Dutchman 
played the Reti Opening, and she treated 
it the way she did when Benny played it, getting 
equality 
by the ninth move. She began attacking 
before he had a 
chance to castle, 
at first 
with a 
bishop 
sacrifice and then by 
forcing him to give up a knight 
and two pawns to defend 
his king. By the sixteenth 
move she 
was threatening 
comÂ­
binations 
all over the board and although 
she was never 
able to bring one off, the threat 
was enough. He was 
forced to yield to her 
a bit at a time until, bottled 
up and 
irrecoverably 
behind, he gave 
up. She was walking 
hapÂ­
pily along the Rue de Rivoli 
by noon, enjoying 
the sunÂ­
shine. She looked at blouses 
and shoes in the shop windows, 
and while she bought nothing, it was a pleasure. 
Paris was 
a bit like New Y ark but more civilized. The streets 
were 
clean and the 
shop windows bright; 
there were real sideÂ­
walk cafes and people 
sitting in them en
joying 
themselves, 
talking 
in French. She had been so wrapped 
up in chess 
that only now did she realize: 
she was actually 
in Paris!

toward her were FrenchÂ­
and she herself 
was eighteen 
years 
old and the 
United 
States Champion 
at chess. She felt for a 
moment a 
joyful pressure 
in her chest and 
slowed her 
walking. Two 
men were passing her, heads 
bent in converÂ­
sation, 
and she heard one saying 
. " Frenchmen , and she understood 
the words! 
She stopped 
walking 
and stood where she was for a moÂ­
ment, taking 
in the fine gray buildings 
across 
the avenue, 
the light on the trees, the odd smells 
of this humane city. 
She might have 
an apartment here 
someday, on the BouleÂ­
vard Raspail 
or the Rue 
des Capucines. 
By the time 
she 
was in her 
twenties 
she could 
be World' s Champion 
and 
live wherever 
she wanted to live. She could have a pied a 
terre in Paris and go to concerts and plays, eat lunch every 
day in 
a different cafe, and dress like these women 
who 
walked by her, so sure of themselves, so smart in their 
well-made clothes, with their heads high and their hair 
impeccably 
cut and combed and shaped. 
She had someÂ­
thing that none of them had, and it could give her a life 
that anyone 
might envy. Benny had been right to urge her 
to play here 
and then, next summer, 
in Moscow. There 
was nothing 
to hold her in 
Kentucky
, in her house; 
she had 
possibilities 
that were endless. 
She wandered 
the boulevards for hours, not stopping 
to 
buy anything, 
just looking at people 
and buildings 
and 
shops and restaurants and 
trees and flowers
. Once she 
accidentally 
bumped into an old lady while crossing 
the 
Rue de Ia Paix and found herself saying 
madame' ' as easily 
as if she had been speaking 
French all 
her life. 

"Excusez-moi,

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

There was to be a reception at the 
building 
the tournaÂ­
ment was in at four-thirt
y; she had difficulty 
finding her 
way back and was ten minutes 
late and out of 
breath 
when 
she arrived. The playing 
tables 
had all been pushed to one 
side of 
the room, and the chairs placed 
around the walls. 
She was 
ushered 
to a seat 
near the 
door and handed a small 
cup of cafe filtre. A pastry 
cart was wheeled 
by with the 
most beautiful pastries 
she had ever seen
. She felt a moÂ­
mentary 
sadness, wishing 
that Alma Wheatley 
could be 
there to see them. Just as she was taking 
a napoleon 
from 
the cart 
she heard loud laughter from across the room and 
looked up. 
There was Vasily Borgov, holding 
a coffee 
cup. The people 
on each side of him were bent toward him 
expectantly, taking 
in his amusement. 
His face was disÂ­
torted 
with ponderous 
mirth. Beth felt her stomach 
tum to 
ice. 
She walked back to 
her hotel that evening 
and grimly 
played a dozen of Borgov' s games-games 
that she alÂ­
ready knew thoroughly 
from studying them with 
BennyÂ­
and went to bed at eleven; 
she took no pills and slept 
beautif
ully. Borgov had been 
an International 
Grandmaster 
for eleven years and World Champion for 
five, but she 
would not go passive against 
him this time. Whatever 
happened 
she would not be humiliated by him. And she 
would have one distinct 
advantage
: he would not be as 
prepared 
for her as 
she was for him. 

She went on winning, 
beating 
a Frenchman 
the next day 
and an Englishman 
on the day 
after. Borgov won his 
games also. On the next to the 
last day when she 
was 
playing 
another 
Dutchman-an older and more experiÂ­
enced one-she found 
herself 
at the 
table next to Borgov. 

255 

WALTER TEVIS 

Seeing 
him so close distracted 
her for a few moments, but 
she was able to shrug it off. The Dutchman 
was a strong 
player, 
and she concentrated on the game. When she 
finished, 
forcing a resignation after nearly 
four hours, 
she 
looked 
up and saw 
that the pieces 
were gone from the next 
table and 
Borgov had left. 
Leaving, she stopped 
at the desk and asked whom she 
would be playing in the morning. The director shuffled 
through 
his papers 
and smiled 
faintly. 
"Grandmaster 
Borgov, 
mademoisel
le.' ' 
She had expected 
it, but her breath 
caught 
when he said 
it. 
That night she 
took three tranquilizers 
and went to bed 
early, uncertain 
if she could relax enough to sleep. But she 
slept beautif
ully and awoke refreshed at eight, 
feeling 
confident, smart and 
ready. 

When she came in and saw him 
sitting 
at the 
table, 
he did 
not seem so formidable. He was wearing 
his usual 
dark 
suit, and his coarse black hair was combed neatly 
back 
from his 
forehead. 
His face 
was, as always, impassive, 
but 
it did 
not look threatening. 
He stood up politely, 
and when 
she offered her hand he shook it, but he did not smile. She 
would be playing the white pieces; 
when they 
seated 
themÂ­
selves 
he pressed 
the button 
on her clock. 
She had already 
decided 
what to do. Despite 
Benny's 
advice, 
she would play pawn 
to king four and hope for the 
Sicilian. 
She had gone through all 
of Borgov's published 
Sicilian 
games. She did it, picking 
up the pawn and setting 
it on the fourth rank, and when he 
played his queen bishop 
pawn she felt a pleasant 
thrill. She was 
ready for him. She 
played her knight 
to king bishop three; 
he brought 
his to 

256 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

queen bishop 
three, 
and by the sixth move they 
were in the 
Boleslavski
. She knew, move by move, eight games in 
which Borgov had played this 
variati
on, had gone over 
each of them with Benny, analyzing each 
remorselessly. 
He started 
the variation 
with pawn 
to king four on the sixth 
move; she played 
knight 
to knight 
three with the certainty 
that came 
from knowing 
she was right, 
and then looked 
across 
the board at him. He was leaning 
a cheek against 
a 
fist, looking 
down at 
the board like any other chess player. 
Borgov was strong, imperturbable 
and wily, but there was 
no sorcery 
in his 
play. He put his bishop on king two 
without 
looking 
at her. She castled. 
He castled. 
She looked 
around herself 
at the bright, beautif
ully furnished 
room she 
was in with its two other games of chess quietly 
in progress . 
B y the fifteenth move she began to see combinations 
opening 
up on both 
sides, and by the twentieth 
she was 
startled 
by her own clarity . Her mind moved with ease, 
picking 
its way 
delicately 
among the combination 
of moves. 
She began to pressur
e him along the queen 
bishop file, 
threatening 
a double attack. He side-st
epped this, and 
she 
strengthened 
her center 
pawns. Her position 
opened more 
and more, and the possibilities 
for attack increased
, alÂ­
though Borgov seemed 
to side-step 
them just in time. She 
knew this might happen and it did 
not dismay her; she 
felt 
in herself 
an inexhaustible ability 
to find strong, threatenÂ­
ing moves
. She had never 
played better. 
She would force 
him by a series 
of threats 
to compromise 
his position, and 
then she would mount threats 
that were double and triple 
and that he would not be able to avoid. Already his queen 
bishop was locked in by moves she had 
forced," and his 
queen was tied down protecting 
a rook. Her pieces 
were 

257 

WALTER TEVIS 

freeing themselves 
more with every move. There seemed 
to be no end to her ability 
to find threats . 
She looked 
around again. The other games 
were finÂ­
ished. 
That was a surprise. She looked at her wat
ch. It was 
for over three 
after one 
o'clock. They had been playing 
hours. She turned 
her attention 
back to the board, studied 
it a few minutes 
and brought 
her queen to the center. 
It 
was time to apply 
more pressur
e. She looked across 
the 
table at 
Borgov. 
He was as unruffled as ever. 
He did not meet her eyes 
but kept his on the board, studying 
her queen move. Then 
he shrugged 
almost imperceptibly 
and attacked 
the queen 
with a rook. She had known he might do that, and she had 
her response 
ready. She interposed 
a knight, 
threate
ning a 
check that would take the rook. He would have to move 
the king now 
and she would bring the queen over to the 
rook file. She could see half a dozen ways of threatening 
him from there, with threats 
more urgent 
than the ones she 
had been making. 
Borgov moved immediate
ly, and he did not move 
his 
king. He merely advanced 
a rook pawn. She had to study 
it for five 
minutes before seeing 
what he was up to. If she 
checked 
him, he would let her take the rook and then 
station 
his bishop ahead of the pawn he had j ust pushed, 
and she would have 
to move her queen. She held her 
breath, 
alarmed. Her rook on the back rank would fall , and 
with it two pawns. That would be disastrous . She had to 
back her queen off to a place where 
it could 
escape. She 
gritted 
her teeth and moved it. 
Borgov brought 
the bishop 
out, anyway, where the pawn 
protected it. 
She stared 
at it a moment before the meaning 
of it dawned on her; any of the several 
moves she could 

258 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

make to dislodge 
it would cost her in some 
way, and if she 
left it there, 
it strengthened 
everything 
about his position. 
She looked 
up at his face. He was regarding her now 
with 
a hint of a smile. She looked quickly 
back at the board. 
She tried countering with one of her own bishops, but 
he neutralized 
it with a pawn move that blocked 
the diagoÂ­
nal. She had 
played beautif
ully, was still 
playing 
beautiÂ­
fully, but he was outplaying 
her. She would have to bear 
down harder. 
She did bear down harder 
and found excellent 
moves, as 
good as any she had 
ever found, but they were not enough
. 
By the thirty-f
ifth her throat was dry, 
and what she saw 
in 
front of 
her on the board was the disarray 
of her position 
and the 
growing 
strength 
of Borgov' s . It was incredible. 
She was playing 
her best chess, and 
he was beating 
her. 
On the thirty-eighth 
move he brought 
his rook crisply 
down to her second rank for the first threat 
of mate. She 
could see clearly enough 
how to parry that, but behind it 
were more and more threats 
that would either 
mate her or 
take her queen or give him a second queen. 
She felt sick. 
For a moment it dizzied 
her just to look at the board, at the 
visible 
manifestation 
of her own powerlessness
. 
She did not topple 
her king. She stood 
up, and looking 
at his emotionless 
face, said, "I resign. " Borgov nodded. 
She turned and walked out of the 
room, feeling physically 
ill. 

The plane back to 
New Y ark was like a trap; 
she sat in 
her window seat and could not escape 
the memory of the 
game, could 
not stop playing 
through 
it in her mind. 
Several times 
the stewardess 
offered her a drink, 
but she 
forced herself 
to decline. 
She wanted one only too badly; 
it 
was frightening. 
She took tranquilizers, 
but the knot would 

259 

WALTER TEVIS 

not leave her stomach. She had made no mistakes. She had 
played extraordinarily 
well. And at the end of it her posiÂ­
tion was a shambles, 
and Borgov looked as though it had 
been nothing. 
She did not want to see 
Benny. She was supposed 
to 
call him to pick her up, but she did 
not want to 
go back to 
his apartmen
t. It had been eight weeks since she left her 
house in Lexington; 
she would go back and lick her wounds 
for a while. Her third-prize 
money from Paris had been 
surprisingly 
good; she could afford a quick round trip to 
Lexingto
n . And there were still 
papers to sign with her 
lawyer. 
She would stay a week and then come back and go 
on studying 
with Benny. But what else had 
she to 
learn 
from him? Remembering 
for a moment all the work she 
had done readying 
herself 
for Paris, she felt sick again
. 
With an 
effort 
she shook it off. The main thing was to get 
ready for Moscow. There was still 
time. 
She called 
Benny from Kennedy Airport 
and told him 
she had lost the final game, that Borgov had outplayed 
her. Benny was 
sympathetic 
but a little. distant, 
and when 
she told him she was going to Kentucky 
for. a while he 
sounded 
irritat
ed. 
"Don ' t quit," he said. "One lost 
game doesn' t prove 
anything. " 
"I'm not quitting
, " she said. 

In the pile of mail waiting 
for her at 
home were several 
letters 
from Michael 
Chennault, 
the lawyer who had arÂ­
ranged for the deed to the house. 
It seemed there 
was some 
kind of problem; 
she did not yet have clear title 
or someÂ­
thing. Allston Wheatley 
was creating 
difficulty. Without 

260 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

opening 
the rest of the mail she went to tA.e phone and 
called 
Chennault's 
office. 
The first thing he said when he came on the line was 
" I 
tried to get you three times yesterday. Where've you been?" 
" In Paris, " Beth said, " playing 
chess. " 
"How sweet it must be. " He paused. " It's Wheatley. 
He doesn't want to sign . " 
"Sign what?" 
"Title, " Chennault 
said. "Can you get over 
here? We' ve 
got to work it out.' ' 
" I don't see why you need me, " Beth said. " You' re 
the lawyer. 
He told me he'd sign what was neceasar
y ." 
"He's changed his mind. Maybe you 
could talk to 
him .' ' 

" Is he there?" 

' 

"Not in the office. But he' s in town. I think if you 
could look him in the eye and remind him you're his legal 
daughter 
. . . '
" Why won't he sign?" 
"Money, " the lawyer 
said. "He wants to sell 
the house. " 
"Can the two of you come here tomorrow?" 
' Til see what I can do, " the lawyer said. 
She looked around the living 
room after hanging 
up. 
The house still 
belonged to Wheatley. That was a shock. 
She had 
barely 
seen him in it, and yet 
it was in fact his. 
She did not want him to have it. 
Although 
it was a hot July afternoon, Allston Wheatley 
was wearing 
a suit, 
a dark-gray 
salt-and-pepper 
tweed, 
and 
when he seated himself 
on the sofa 
he pulled up the 
creases 
in the pants legs, showing 
the whiteness 
of his thin 
shanks above the tops of his maroon socks. 
He had lived 
in the house for sixteen years , 
but he showed no interest 
in 

26 1 

WALTER TEVIS 

anything 
in it. He entered 
it like a 
stranger, 
with a 
look 
that could have been anger 
or apology, sat down at one 
end of the sofa, pulled 
his pants legs up an inch and said 
nothing. 
Something about 
him made Beth 
feel sick. He looked 
exactly 
the way he had looked when 
she first saw him, 
when he came 
to Mrs. Deardorffs office with Mrs. Wheatley 
to look her over. 
"Mr. Wheatley 
has a proposal
, Beth , " the lawyer was 
saying. 
She looked at 
Wheatley
's face, which was turned 
slightly 
away from them. " You can live her
e , " the lawyer 
said, " while you are finding something 
permanent. " Why 

wasn ' t Wheatley 
telling 
her this? 

Wheatley's embarrassment 
made her somehow squirm 
for him, as though she were embarrassed 
herself. 
"I thought 
I could keep the house if I made the payments
, " she said. 
"Mr. Wheatley 
says you misconst
rued him." 
Why was her lawyer speaking 
for him? Why couldn' t he 
get his own lawyer, 
for Christ's sake? She looked over at 
him and saw he was lighting 
a cigarette, 
his face still 
inclined away 
from her, a pained look on his features. 
" He claims he was only permitting 
you to stay 
in the 
house until 
you got 
settled
. " 
"That's 
not true, " Beth said. "He said I could have 
it , . . 
' ' Suddenly 
something hit 
her with full force and she 
turned to 
Wheatley. ' 'I'm your daughter," she said. " You 
adopted 
me. Why don't you talk to me?" 
He looked 
at her like a startled rabbit. ' 'Alma,' ' he said, 
' ' Alma wanted a child . . . 
' ' 
" You signed 
the papers, " Beth said. " You took on a 
responsibilit
y . Can't you 
even look 
at me?" 
Allston Wheatley 
stood up and walked across 
the room 

262 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

to the window. When he turned 
around, 
he had somehow 
pulled 
himself 
together, 
and he looked furious. "Alma 
wanted to 
adopt you. Not me. You're not entitled 
to 
everything 
I own just because 
I signed some damned 
papers to shut Alma 
up.' ' He turned back to the window. 
' 'Not that it worked. ' ' 
" You adopted 
me, " Beth said. " I didn' t ask you 
to do 
it. " She felt a choking 
sensation 
in her throat. 
" You're 
my legal father. " 
When he turned 
and looked at her, she was shocked 
to 
see how contorted his face was. "The money in 
this house 
is mine, and no smart-assed orphan 
is going to take it 
away from me. " 
"I'm not an orphan, " Beth said. "I'm your daughter
. " 
"Not in my book you aren't. I don't give a shit what 
your goddamned 
lawyer says. I don't give a shit what 
Alma said either. That woman could 
not keep her mouth 

shut." 

No one spoke for a while. Finally 
Chennault 
asked 
quietly, "What do you want from 
Beth, Mr. Wheatley
?" 
" I want her out of here. I'm selling 
the house. " 
Beth looked at 
him for a moment before speaking
. 
"Then sell it to me, " she said. 
"What are you talking 
about?" 
Wheatley 
said. 
' 'I' II buy it. I' II 
pay you whatever 
your equity is
. " 
" It's worth more than that now . " 
"How much more?" 
' 'I'd need seven thousand
. " 
She knew his equity 
was less than five. ' 'All right , ' ' she 
said. 
" You have that much?" 

263 

WALTER TEVIS 

" Yes, " she 
said. "But I ' m subtracting 
what I paid for 
burying 
my mother. 
I'll show you 
the receipts. " 
Allston 
Wheatley 
sighed 
like a martyr. 
"All right, " he 
said. " You two can 
draw up the papers. I'm going back to 
the hotel. " He walked 
over to the door. "It's too hot in 
here . " 
" You could have taken off your coat , " Beth said. 

It left her two thousand 
in the bank. She didn' t like having 
so little, 
but it was all right. 
In the mail there had been 
invitations 
to play in two strong 
tournaments, with good 
prize money. Fifteen hundred for 
one and two thousand 
for 
the other. 
And there was the heavy envelope 
from Russia, 
inviting her to Moscow 
in July
. 
When she got back with her copy of the signed 
papers 
she walked around the living 
room several 
times, 
passing 
her hand lightly 
over pieces 
of furniture
. Wheatley hadn
' t 
said anything 
about the furniture, 
but i t was hers. She had 
asked the lawyer. 
Wheatley 
hadn' t even shown up, and 
Chennault 
took the papers over to the Phoenix 
Hotel for 
him to sign while she waited in the office and read 
a 
Geographic. The house felt different, now that it 
was hers. She would get some new pieces-a good, low 
sofa and two 
small modem armchairs. She could 
visualize 
them, with pale-blue 
linen uphol
stery and darker blue 
piping. 
Not Mrs. Wheatley 
blue, but her own. Beth blue. 
She wanted 
things 
brighter in 
the living 
room, more cheerÂ­
ful . She wanted to erase Mrs . Wheatley
's half-real presÂ­
ence from 
the place. 
She would get a bright 
rug for the 
floor and have the windows washed. 
She would get a 
stereo 
and some records, a new bedspread 
and pillowcases 
for the bed 
upstairs
. From Purcell' s . Mrs . Wheatley 
had 

National 

264 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

been a good mother; 
she had 
not intended 
to die and leave 
her. 

Beth slept well and awoke feeling angry. 
She put on the 
chenille 
robe and padded downstairs 
in slippers-Mrs. 
Wheatley's sli
ppers-and 
found herself 
thinking 
furiously 
of the seven thousand 
dollars she had paid Allston Wheatley. 
She loved her money; she and Mrs. Wheatley 
had both 
taken great 
pleasure 
in accumulating it from tournament 
to 
tournament, 
watching 
it gather 
interest. They had 
always 
opened Beth ' s bank statements 
together 
to see how much 
new interest 
had been credited 
to the account. 
And after 
Mrs . Wheatley
's death it had consoled 
her to know that 
she could go on living 
in the house, 
buying her groceries 
at the supermarket 
and going to movies when she wanted 
to without 
feeling pinched 
for money or having to think 
about getting 
work or going to college 
or finding 
tournaÂ­
ments to win. 
She had brought 
three of Benny's chess pamphlets 
with 
her from New York; while 
her eggs were boiling 
she set 
up her board 
on the kitchen 
table and got out the booklet 
with games from the last Moscow Invitation
al . The RusÂ­
sian booklets 
were printed 
on expensive 
paper with good, 
clear type. She had not really mastered 
Russian from the 
night course at the 
university
, but she could read the 
names and 
the notations 
easily 
enough. 
Yet the Cyrillic 
characters 
were irrita
ting. It angered 
her that the 
Soviet 
government 
put so much money 
into chess, and that they 
even used a 
different alphabet 
from hers . When 
the eggs 
were done, she peeled them 
into a bowl with butter and 
began playing a game between 
Petrosian 
and Tal. Griinf
eld 
Defense. Semi-Slav 
Variation. She got it to the black 
king 

265 

WALTER TEVIS 

knight on queen two for the eighth 
move and then became 
bored with it. She had been moving the pieces 
too fast for 
analysis, not stopping 
herself 
as Benny would 
have made 
her do to trace 
out everything 
that was going on. She 
finished the last spoonful of egg and went out the back 
door into the garden. 
It was a hot morning. The grass 
in the yard was overÂ­
grown, it nearly 
covered 
the little 
brick pathway 
that went 
to where some shabby tea roses stood. 
She went back into 
the house and played the white rook 
to queen one and then 
stared 
at it. She did not 
want to study chess. 
That was 
frightening; 
a vast amount of study lay ahead of her if she 
wanted to avoid humiliation 
in Moscow. She pushed down 
the fear and went upstairs 
for a shower. 
As she dried her 
hair, she saw with a kind of relief 
that she needed to have 
it cut. That would be something 
to do today. Afterward 
she could go to Purc
ell's and look at sofas for the living 
room. But it wouldn' t be wise to buy-not 
until she had 
more money. And how could she get the lawn mowed? 
A 
boy had done it for Mrs . Wheatley
, but she didn' t know 
his telephone 
number or address. 
She needed to clean up 
the place. 
There were cobwebs 
and messy-looking 
sheets 
and pillowcases
. She could use 
some new ones. Some new cloth
es, too. Harry Beltik 
had 
left his razor in the bathroom; should 
she mail it back? The 
milk had gone sour and the butter was 
old. The freezer 
was full of ice crystals 
with a stack of old frozen chicken 
dinners 
stuck in the back. The bedroom 
rug was dusty, 
and 
the windows 
had fingerprints 
on the glass and grit on the 
sills. 
Beth shook the confusion 
out of her head as well as she 
could and made an appointment 
with Roberta 
for a haircut

at two. She would ask where to find a 
cleaning 
woman for 
a few weeks. She would go to Morri s ' , order some chess 
books, and have lunch at Toby' s . 
But her usual clerk wasn't a t Morris' that day , and the 
woman who had replaced 
him knew nothing 
about orderÂ­
ing chess books. Beth managed to get her to find a cataÂ­
logue and ordered 
three on the Sicilian 
Defense. She needed 
game books from grandmaster 
matches 
But she 
didn't know which Yugoslav 
press published 
Informant, and neither 
did the 
new clerk. 
It was infuriatÂ­
ing. She needed a library as good as Benny' s . Better. 
Thinking 
of this, she finally realized angrily that 
she could 
go back to New York 
and forget all this confusion and 
continue 
with Benny from where she had left off. But what 
could Benny teach her 
now? What could any American 
teach her? She had moved 
past them all. She was 
on her 
own. She would have to 
bridge the 
gap herself 
that sepaÂ­
rated American 
chess from Russian. 
At Toby' s the headwaiter 
knew her 
and put her 
at a 
good table near the front. She ordered 
for an appetizer 
and told the waiter 
she would have that 
before ordering 
a main course. "Would you care for a 
cocktail?" he asked pleasant! 
y. She looked around 
her at 
the quiet restaura
nt, at the people 
eating 
lunch, at the table 
with desserts 
near the velvet 
rope at the entrance 
to the 
dining 
room. "A Gibson, " she said. " On the rocks. " 
It came almost immediatel
y. It was wonderful 
to look 
at. The tumbler 
was clear and clean; 
the gin inside 
was 
crystalline, the white 
onions were like two pearls. When 
she tasted 
it, it stung 
her upper lip , then stung 
her throat 
with a sweet tease as it went down. The effect on her 
tense 
stomach 
was remarkable; 
everything 
about it was reward-

ing. She finished 
it slowly, and the 
deep fury in her began 
to subside. 
She ordered 
another. 
Back in 
the shadows 
at 
the far end of the room someone 
was playing 
a piano. 
Beth 
looked at her 
watch. It was a quarter 
to twelve. 
It was 
good to be alive. 
She never got 
around to ordering 
the main course. 
She 
came out of Toby' s at two, squinting 
into the sunshine, 
and jaywalked 
across 
Main to David Manly's Wine Shop. 
Using two of her 
traveler's checks from Ohio she bought a 
case of Paul Masson burgundy, 
four bottles 
of Gordon's 
gin and a bottle 
of Martini 
& Rossi vermouth 
and had Mr. 
Manly call her a taxi. Her speech was clear and 
sharp; 
her 
gait was steady. She had eaten six stalks 
of asparagus 
and 
drunk four Gibsons. She had flirted 
with alcohol for 
years . 
It was time to consummate 
the relationship. 
The phone was 
ringing 
when she came in, 
but she did 
not answer it. The driver 
helped 
her with the 
case of wine, 
and she tipped 
him a dollar. 
When he had 
left, 
she got the 
bottles out 
one at a time and put them neatly into the 
cabinet 
over the toaster, in 
front of Mrs. Wheatley
' s old 
cans of spaghetti 
and chili. Then she opened a bottle 
of gin 
and twisted 
the cap 
off the vermouth
. She had never made 
a cocktail 
before. She poured gin into 
the tumbler and 
added a little 
vermouth, 
stirring 
it with one 
of Mrs. 
Wheatley
' s spoons. 
She carried 
the drink caref
ully into the 
living 
room, sat down and took a long swallow. 

The mornings 
were horrible, but she managed them. She 
went to Kroger's on the third day and bought three dozen 
eggs and a supply of TV dinners. After that she always 
had two eggs 
before her first 
glass of wine. By noon she 
had usually 
passed out
. She would awake on the sofa or in 

268 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

a chair with 
her limbs stiff and the back 
of her qeck 
damp 
with hot sweat
. Sometimes
, her head reeling, 
she would 
feel in the depth of her stomach 
an anger as intense 
as the 
pain of a burst abscess 
in the jaw-a toothache 
so potent 
that nothing 
but drink could alleviate it. Sometimes 
the 
drink had 
to be forced against 
a rejection 
of it by her body, 
but she did it. She would get it down and wait and the 
feelings would 
subside 
a bit. It was like turning down the 
volume. 
On Saturday morning she spilled 
wine on her kitchen 
chessboard, and on Monday she bumped into 
the table by 
accident 
and sent some of the pieces 
falling to the floor. 
She left them there, picking 
them up only on Thursday, 
when finally 
the young man came by to mow the lawn. 
She lay on the sofa drinking 
from the last 
bottle 
in her case 
and listened 
to the roaring 
of his power mower, smelling 
the grass 
cuttings. When she had 
paid him, she went 
outside into the grass 
smell and looked 
at the lawn with 
its 
clumps of cuttings
. It touched her to see 
it so altered
, so 
changed 
from what it had been. She went back in, got her 
purse and called 
a cab. The law did not permit deliveries 
of wine 
or liquor. 
She would have to get another 
case on 
her own. Two would be smarter. 
And she would try 
Almaden. Someone had said Almaden 
burgundy 
was betÂ­
ter than Paul Masson. 
She would try it. Maybe 
a few 
bottles 
of white wine, too. And she 
needed food . 
Lunches 
came from a can. The chili was pretty good 
if 
you added pepper and ate it with a glass of burgundy. 
Almaden was better 
than Paul 
Masson, 
less astringent 
on 
the tongue. 
The Gibsons, 
though, could hit her like a 
club, 
and she became wary of them, saving them until just 
before 
passing 
out or, 
sometimes, for the first drink in the

morning. By 
the third week she was taking 
a Gibson up to 
bed with her on the nights 
she made 
it upstairs 
to bed. She 
put it on the nightst
and with a Chess Inf
ormant over it to 
keep the alcohol 
from evaporating, and drank it when she 
then, in the 
woke up in the middle of the night. 
Or if not 
morning, 
before going 
downstairs . 
Sometimes 
the phone rang, but she answered 
it only 
when her head and voice were clear. 
She always spoke 
aloud to check her level of sobriety 
before picking 
up the 
receiver. 
She would say "Peter Piper picked 
a peck of 
pickled 
peppers, " and if it came out all 
right, 
she would 
take up the phone. A woman called 
from New York, 
wanting 
She refused. 
It wasn't until her third week of drinking 
that she 
went 
through 
the pile of magazines 
that had come while she was 
in New York and found the 
Newsweek with her picture 
in 
it. They had given her a full page under "Sport . " The 
picture showed her playing 
Benny, and she remembered 
the moment it was taken, 
during 
the game' s opening. The 
position 
of the pieces 
on the display 
board was visible 
in 
the photogra
ph, and she saw that her memory was right, 
she had just made her fourth 
move. Benny 
looked thoughtÂ­
ful and distant, 
as usual. The piece said she 
was the most 
talented 
woman since Vera Menchik. 
Beth, reading it 
halfÂ·drunk, was annoyed 
at the space given to Mench
ik, 
going on about her death in a 1 944 bombing in London 
before pointing 
out that Beth was the 
better 
player. 
And 
what did being women have to do with 
it? She was better 
than any male player 
in America. 
She remembered 
the Life 
interviewer 
and the questi-ons 
about her being a woman in 
a man' s world. To hell with her; 
it wouldn' t be a man' s 
world when she finished 
with it. I t was noontime, 
and she 

270 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

put a pan of canned spaghetti 
on to heat 
before reading 
the 
rest of the article. 
The last paragraph 
was the strongest. 

At eighteen
, Beth Harmon has established 
herself 
as the 
queen of American 
chess. She may be the most 
gifted 
player since Morphy or 
Capablanca; 
no one knows just 
how gifted 
she is-how great a 
potential 
she holds in 
that young girl's body with its dazzling 
brain . To find 
out, to show the world if America has outgrown 
its 
inferior 
status 
in world chess, she will have to go where 
the big boys are. She will have 
to go to the Soviet 
Union. 

Beth closed 
the magazine 
and poured a glass of Almaden 
Mountain 
Chablis 
to drink with her spaghetti
. It was three 
in the afternoon 
and hot as 
fury. And the wine was 
getting 
low; only two more bottles 
stood on the shelf 
above the 
toaster. 

A week after reading 
the Newsweek article 
she awoke on a 
Thursday morning too sick to get 
out of bed. When she 
tried to 
sit up, she couldn't. Her head and stomach 
were 
throbbing. She was still wearing 
her jeans and T-shirt 
from 
the night before, and she felt suffocated 
by them. But 
she 
could not get them off. The shirt was stuck to her upper 
body, and she was too weak to 
pull it over her head. There 
was a Gibson on the nightst
and. She managed 
to roll over 
and take it with both hands, and she got half of it down 
before beginning 
to retch. For a moment she thought 
she 
was choking, 
but her breath 
came back eventually and she 
finished 
the drink. 
She was terrified. She was 
alone in that furnace of a 

27 1 

WALTER TEVIS 

room and frightened 
of dying. 
Her stomach 
was raw and 
all of her organs hurt. Had she poisoned herself 
on wine 
and gin? She tried sitting 
up again, and with the gin in her 
she managed it. She sat there 
for a few moments calming 
herself 
before she went unsteadily 
into the bathroom 
and 
vomited. It 
seemed to cleanse 
her. She managed 
to get her 
clothes 
off, and afraid of slipping 
in the shower and breakÂ­
ing her hip 
the way unsteady 
old women 
did, she filled 
the 
tub with 
lukewarm water and took a bath . 
She should 
call 
McAndrews, Mrs. Wheatley
' s old doctor, 
and make an 
appointment 
for sometime 
around noon. If she could make 
it to his office. This was more than a hangover; 
she was 
ill. 
But downstairs, 
after her bath, she was steadier 
and got 
down two eggs with 
no difficulty. The thought of 
picking 
up the phone and calling someone 
seemed distant 
now. 
There was a 
barrier 
between herself 
and whatever 
world 
the phone would attach her to; 
she could not penetrate 
the 
barrier. She 
would be all right. 
She would drink less, 
taper 
off. Maybe she would feel like calling 
McAndrews 
after a 
drink. She poured 
herself 
a glass of Chablis 
and began 
sipping 
it, and it healed her like the magic medicine 
it 
was. 

The next morning while she was eating 
breakfast 
the phone 
rang and she picked 
it up without 
thinking. 
Someone 
named Ed Spencer 
was at the other 
end; it took a moment 
to remember 
that he was the local tournament 
director. 
" It's about tomorrow, " he said. 
' 'Tomorrow? ' ' 
"The tournament. 
We wondered if you could 
come an 
hour early. The Louisville 
paper is sending 
a photographer 

272 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

and we think WLEX will 
have somebody. Could you 
come in at nine?" 
Her heart sank. He was talking 
about the Kentucky 
State 
Championship, 
she had 
completely 
forgotten 
it. She was 
supposed 
to defend her title. 
She was supposed 
to go to 
Henry Clay High School tomorrow 
morning and begin a 
two-day 
tournament 
as defending champion. 
Her head was 
throbbing and her hand 
that held her coffee cup was 
unsteady. 
"I don't know, " she said. "Can you call back 
in an hour?' ' 
" Sure, Miss Harmon. " 
"Thank you
. I'll tell you in 
an hour." 
She felt frightened, and she did not want to play chess. 
She had not looked 
at a chess book or touched 
her pieces 
since buying 
the house from Allston Wheatley. She did not 
want even to think about chess. Last night' s bottle 
was still 
sitting 
on the counter 
next to the toaster. 
She poured half a 
glass, but when 
she drank it, it 
stung her mouth and tasted 
foul . She set the unfinished 
glass in the sink and got 
orange j uice from the ref
rigerator. 
If she 
didn't clear her 
head and play the tournament, 
she would just be drunker 
tomorrow 
and sicker. 
She finished 
the orange juice and 
went upstairs, 
thinking 
of all the wine she 
had been drinkÂ­
ing, remembering 
it in the pit of her stomach. Her insides 
felt fouled and 
abused. She needed a hot shower and 
fresh 
clothes. 
It would be a waste. Beltik wouldn't be in it, 
and there 
was no one else as good as he . 
Kentucky 
was nothing 
in 
chess. 
Standing 
naked in the bathroom, she started 
going 
through 
the Levenfish 
Variation 
of the Sicilian
, squinting 
her eyes and 
picturing 
the pieces 
on an imaginary 
board. 
She did the 
first dozen moves without 
a mistake, 
although 

273 

WALTER TEVIS 

the pieces didn't stand out as clearly 
as they had a year 
before. She hesitated after move 
eighteen
, where Black 
played pawn to knight four and got equality. SmyslovÂ­
Botvinnik, 1 958. She tried to play out the rest of it, but 
her head was aching, 
and after stopping 
to take two aspiÂ­
rin , she wasn' t sure where the pawns were 
supposed 
to be. 
But she had gotten the first eighteen moves 
right. 
She 
would stay sober today 
and play tomorrow. When she won 
the state championship 
for the second time two years 
before, it had 
been simple. 
After herself 
and maybe Harry, 
there weren' t any really 
strong players in Kentucky. 
Goldmann 
and Sizemore were no problem. 
When the phone rang again she told Ed Spencer 
she'd 
be there at nine-thir
ty. A half-hour 
would be plenty 
of time 
for pictures. 

from the Herald-Lead
er, 

In the back of her mind 
she had hoped Townes might show 
up with a camera, 
but there was no sign 
of him. The man 
from Louisville 
wasn't there either. She 
posed at Board 
One for a woman photographer 
did a three-minute 
interview 
with a man from a local 
television 
station
, and excused 
herself 
to go out for 
a walk 
around the 
block before the tournament 
began. She had 
managed to get through 
the day before 
without 
drinking 
and had slept soundly 
enough with the help of three green 
pills, but her stomach 
felt queasy . It was still 
morning but 
the sun was too bright; 
she found herself 
beginning 
to 
sweat after one tum around the block. Her feet hurt. 
Eighteen 
years old, and she felt like forty. She would 
have 
to stop drinking. 
Her first opponent 
was somebody 
named 
Foster 
with a rating 
in the 1 800s . She would be playing 

274 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

Black, but it should 
be easy-especially 
if he tried 
pawn to 
king four and let her get 
into the Sicilian. 
Foster seemed 
calm enough, 
considering 
that he was 
playing 
the U . S . Champion 
in his first round. 
He had the 
good sense not to open with the king 
pawn against 
her. He 
played pawn to queen four, and she decided 
to avoid the 
Queen's Gambit and try to lead him into unfamiliar 
terriÂ­
tory with the Dutch 
Defense. That meant 
pawn to king 
bishop four. They went through 
the book moves for a 
while until, somehow, she found herself getting into the 
Stonewall 
Formation
. It was a position 
she did not 
particuÂ­
larly like, and after she started 
considering the way the 
board looked she began to feel annoyed 
with herself. 
The 
thing to do was break it open and 
go for Foster's throat. 
She had just been diddling 
with him, and she wanted to get 
this over with. Her head was still 
aching, 
and she felt 
uncomfortable even in the good swivel 
chair. 
There were 
too many spectators 
in the room. Foster 
was a pale blond 
in his twenties
; he made his moves with a prissy 
carefulÂ­
ness that was maddening. After the twelfth she looked at 
the tight position 
on the board and quickly 
pushed a center 
pawn up for sacrifice; 
she would open up the game 
and 
start threatening. 
She must have a good 600 rating 
points 
on this creep; 
she would wipe him out, get a good lunch 
and some coffee, and be ready for Goldmann 
or Sizemore 
in the afterno
on. 
Somehow the pawn sacrifice 
had been hasty. After FosÂ­
ter took with 
a knight 
instead 
of the pawn she had planned 
on, she found she had either 
to defend or to drop another 
pawn. She bit her lip, annoyed, 
and looked 
for something 
to terrorize 
him with. But she could find nothing. And her 

275 

WALTER TEVIS 

mind was working 
with damnable 
slowness. 
She retreated 
a bishop 
to protect 
the pawn. 
Foster 
raised 
his eyebrows 
slightly at 
that and brought 
a 
rook over 
to the queen file, the one she had 
opened with 
her pawn sacrifice. She blinked. She did not like the way 
this was going. 
Her headache 
was getting 
worse. She got 
up from the board, went to the director 
and asked him for 
aspirin. He found some somewhere
, and she took three, 
chasing 
them with water from a paper cup, before she 
went back to 
Foster. 
As she walked through 
the main 
tournament 
room people looked up from their games 
to 
stare at her. She was suddenly 
angry that she had agreed 
to 
play in this third-rate 
tournament, and angry 
that she had 
to go back and contend 
with Foster. 
She hated the situaÂ­
tion: if she beat him, it was meaningless 
to her, and if he 
beat her, she would 
look terrible. 
But he wouldn't beat 
her. Benny Watts couldn't beat her, and some prissy 
gradÂ­
uate student 
from Louisville 
wasn' t about to drive her into 
a comer. She would find a combination 
somewhere and 
tear him apart with it. 
B ut there was no combination 
to be found. She kept 
staring 
at the position 
as it changed 
gradually 
from move 
to move, and it did not open up for her. Foster was 
good--clearly 
better 
than his rating 
showed-but 
he wasn't 
that good. The people 
who filled 
the little 
room watched 
in 
silence 
as she went more 
and more on the 
defensive, 
trying 
to keep her face from showing 
the alarm that was beginÂ­
ning to dominate 
her moves. And what was wrong with 
her mind? She hadn't had a drink for a day and 
two nights. 
What was wrong? In the pit of her stomach 
she was 
beginning 
to feel terrified. If she had 
somehow damaged 
her talent 
. . . 

276 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

And then, on the twenty-third 
move, Foster began a 
series 
of trades 
in the center 
of the board, and she found 
herself 
unable to stop it, 
watching 
her pieces 
disappear 
with a sick feeling in her stomach, 
watching 
her position 
become more 
and more stark in its deteriorat
ion. She 
found herself 
playing 
out a lost game, overwhelmed 
by the 
two-pawn 
advantage 
of a player 
with a rating 
of 1 800. 
There was nothing she 
could do about it. 
He would queen 
a pawn and humiliate her with 
it. 
She lifted her king 
from the board before he could 
do it 
and left the 
room without 
looking 
at him, pushing 
her way 
through 
a crowd of people, avoiding 
their eyes, almost 
holding 
her breath, going out into 
the main room and up to 
the desk. 
' T m feeling ill , " she told the director. 
"I'm going to 
have to drop 
out." 
She walked up Main, heavy-footed 
and in turmoil, trying 
not to think about the 
game. It was 
horrible. She had 
allowed 
this tournament 
to be a test for her-the kind 
of 
rigged test an alcoholic 
makes for himself
-and still 
she 
had failed it. She must not drink when she 
got home. She 
must read and play chess and get herself 
together. 
But the 
thought 
of going to the empty 
house was frightening. 
What 
else could she do? There was nothing 
she wanted to do and 
no one to cal l . The game she had 
lost was inconsequential 
and the tournament 
was nothing, but the humiliation 
was 
overwhelming. She did not want to hear discussions 
about 
how she had lost to Foster, 
did not want to see Foster 
himself 
again. She must not drink. She had a real tournaÂ­
ment coming up in California in five months. What if she 
shaved 
away from the surface of her brain whatever 
synaptic 

had already 
done it to herself? What if she had 

277 

WALTER TEVIS 

interlacings 
had formed her gift? She remembered 
reading 
somewhere 
that some pop artist 
once bought an original 
drawing 
by Michelangelo
-and had taken a piece of art 
gum and erased it, leaving 
blank paper. 
The waste had 
shocked 
her. Now 
she felt a similar 
shock as 
she imagined 
the surface of her own brain with the talent 
for chess 
wiped away. 
At home she 
tried a Russian 
game book, but she 
couldn't 
concentrate. She started going through her 
game with FosÂ­
ter, setting 
the board up in the kitchen , but the moves of 
it 
were too painful. That damned Stonewall, and the 
hastily 
pushed pawn. A patzer's move. Bad chess. Hungover 
chess. The telephone 
rang, but she didn't answer. 
She sat 
at the board and wished 
for a moment, 
painfully, that she 
had someone 
to call . Harry Beltik 
would be back in LouisÂ­
ville. And she didn't want to tell him about the game with 
Foster. 
He would find out soon enough. 
She could call 
Benny. But Benny had been icy after Paris, and she did 
not want to talk to him. There was no one else. She got 
up 
wearily and opened the 
cabinet 
next to the refrigerator, 
took down a bottle 
of white wine and poured herself 
a 
glassful. A voice inside 
her cried out at the outrage, but 
she ignored it. 
She drank half of 
it in 
one long swallow 
and stood waiting 
until she could feel it. Then 
she finished 
the glass and poured another. 
A person could live without 
chess. Most people 
did. 
When she awoke on the sofa the next morning, still 
wearing 
the Paris clothes she 
had worn when losing 
the 
game to 
Foster, she 
was frightened in 
a new way. She 
could sense her brain being 
physically 
blurred by alcohol
, 
its positional 
grasp gone clumsy, its penetration 
clouded. 
But after breakfast 
she showered 
and changed 
and then 

278 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

poured herself 
a glass of wine. It was almost 
mechanical; 
she had 
learned to cut off thought 
as she did 
it. The main 
thing was to eat some toast 
first, so the wine wouldn' t 
bum her stomach. 
She kept drinking 
for days, but the memory of 
the game 
she had lost and the fear of what she was doing to the 
sharp edge of her gift would not go away, except 
when she 
was so drunk that she could not even think. 
There was a 
piece in the Sunday paper about her, with 
one of the 
pictures 
taken that morning at the high school, and a 
headline 
reading 
CHESS CHAMP DROPS FROM TOURNEY. 
She threw the paper away without 
reading 
the article. 
Then one morning 
after a night of dark and confusing 
dreams she awoke with an unaccustomed 
clarity: 
if she did 
not stop drinking 
immediately 
she would ruin what she 
had. She had allowed 
herself 
to sink into this frightening 
murk. She had to find 
a foothold somewhere to push 
herself 
free of it. She would have 
to get help. With a great 
sense of relief, 
she suddenly 
knew who it was she wanted 
to get help from.

CHAPTER 1 3 

Jolene was not in the Lexington 
directory. Beth tried 
Information 
in Louisville 
and Frankfort. No 
Jolene DeÂ­
Witt. She could have married 
and changed 
her name. She 
could be in Chicago 
or the Klondike 
for that matter; 
Beth 
had not seen or heard from her since the day she left 
Methuen. And there was only one thing to do if she was to 
go through 
with this. 
Her adoption 
papers 
were in a drawer 
in Mrs. Wheatley
' s desk. She got the 
folder 
out and found 
a letter with the Methuen name 
and slogan 
at the top of it 
in red. The phone number was there. She held the paper 
nervously for several 
moments. At the bottom it 
was signed 
in a smal l , neat hand: Helen Deardorff, Superinte
ndent. 
It was almost 
noon, and she had not had a drink yet. For 
a moment she thought 
of steadying 
herself 
with a Gibson, 
but she could not hide the stupidity 
of that idea 
from 
herself. 
A Gibson would be the end of her resolve. She 

280 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

might be alcoholic, but she was not a fool. She went 
upstairs 
and got her bottle 
of Mexican Librium and 
took 
two. Waiting 
for the tension 
to ease, she walked into the 
yard which the boy had mowed the day before. The tea 
roses had 
finally bloomed. The 
petals had 
fallen from most 
of them, and at the end 
of some of the stems were spherical, 
pregnant-looking 
hips where the flowers 
had been. She 
had never noticed 
them when they were 
blooming 
in June 
and July. 
Back in the kitchen, 
she felt steadier
. The tranquilizers 
were working. How many 
brain cells did they kill with each 
milligram? It couldn
' t be as bad as liquor. 
She walked into 
the living 
room and dialed 
the Methuen 
Home. 
The operator 
at Methuen 
put her on hold. Beth reached 
over to the bottle, 
shook out a green pill and swallowed 
it. 
Finally 
the voice came, 
shockingly 
crisp, from the reÂ­
ceiver. 
"Helen Deardorff 
speaking
. " 
For a moment she couldn't speak and wanted to 
hang 
up, but she sucked in her breath 
and said, "Mrs. Deardorff, 
this is Beth Harmon. " 
"Really?" 
The voice sounded 
surprised. 
' ' Yes . ' ' 
"Well." During the pause that followed it occurred 
to 
Beth that Mrs. Deardorff 
might have nothing 
to say. She 
might find it as difficult 
talking 
to Beth as Beth did talking 
to her. "Well, " Mrs. Deardorff said, " we've been readÂ­
ing about you . ' ' 
"How's Mr. Shaibel?" Beth asked. 
"Mr. Shaibel 
is still 
with us. Is that what you called 
about?" 
"I called 
about Jolene 
DeWitt. 
I need to 
get in touch 
with her." 

281 

WALTER TEVIS 

' 'I ' m sorry , " Mrs. Deardorff said. "Methuen cannot 
give out the addresses 
or phone numbers of its charges. ' ' 
"Mrs . Deardorf
f," Beth said, her voice suddenly 
breakÂ­
ing through 
into feeling, 
"Mrs. Deardorff, 
do this for me. 
I have to talk to Jolene.' ' 
"There are laws-" 
" Mrs Deardorf
f, " Beth said, "please." 
Mrs. Deardorf
f' s voice 
took on a different tone. "All 
right, 
Elizabeth. DeWitt lives in Lexington. Here ' s her 
phone number." 

"Jesus 
fucking 
Christ! " Jolene 
said on the phone. "Jesus 
fucking Christ! " 
"How are you, Jolene?" 
Beth felt like crying, 
but she 
kept the quaver out of her voice. 
"Oh my God, child, " Jolene 
said, laughing
. "It is so 
good to hear your voice. 
Are you still 
ugly?" 
' 'Are you still 
black?'' 
"I am one black lady, " Jolene 
said. " And you' ve lost 
your ugly. I saw you in more magazines 
than Barbra 
Streisand. 
My famous friend.' ' 
"Why didn't you call?" 
"Jealous
. " 
"Jolene, " Beth said, " did you ever get adopted?" 
" Shit, no. I graduated 
from that place. 
Why in hell 
didn't you mail me a card or a box of cookies?" 
"I'll 
buy you dinner 
tonight. 
Can you 
get to Toby's on 
Main Street 
at seven?'' 
"I'll cut a class, " Jolene 
said. " Son of a bitch! U . S . 
Champion 
at the 
historic 
game of chess. A genuine 
winner." 
"That's what I 
want to talk about, " Beth said. 
When they met at Toby's the spontaneity was gone. 

282 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

Beth had spent the day without 
a drink, had her hair 
cut at 
Roberta's and cleaned 
up the kitchen , almost overcome 
with the excitement 
of talking 
to Jolene 
again. She arrived 
at Toby' s a quarter of an hour early and nervously turned 
down the waiter' s offer to bring 
her a drink. 
She had a 
Coke in front of 
her when Jolene 
arrived. 
At first Beth didn
't recognize 
her. The woman who 
came toward her table 
in what looked 
like a Coco Chane) 
suit and a full, bushy Afro was so tall that Beth could not 
believe 
it was Jolene. 
She looked like a movie star, or a 
rock-and-roll 
princess
-fuller in the figure 
than Diana Ross 
and as cool as Lena Home. But when Beth saw that it was 
in fact Jolene, 
that the 
smile and the 
eyes were the Jolene 
she remembered, she stood up awkwardly, and they emÂ­
braced. Jolene' s perfume was strong. Beth felt selfÂ­
conscious. Jolene 
patted 
her back while they hugged, and 
said, ' 'Beth Harmon. Old Beth.' ' 
They sat down and looked at each other awkwardly. 
Beth decided 
she had to have a drink to see her through 
this. But when the waiter came, blessedly 
breaking 
the 
silence, 
Jolene 
ordered 
a club soda and 
Beth had him bring 
her another 
Coke. 
Jolene was carrying something 
in a manila envelope, 
which she set on the table in front of 
Beth. Beth picked it 
up. It 
was a book, and she knew immediately 
what it was. 
She slipped 
off the envelope. 
Her old, nearly 
worn-out 
copy. 
"Me all the time, " Jolene said. "Pissed at you for 
being adopted. " 
Beth grimaced, 
opening 
the book to the title page 
where 
the childish handwriting read 
"Elizabeth 
Harmon, Methuen 
Home. " "What about for being white?" 

Modern Chess Openings. 

283 

WALTER TEVIS 

' 'Who could forget? ' ' Jolene 
said. 
Beth looked at Jolene' s good, beautiful 
face with all the 
remarkable 
hair and the long 
black eyelashes 
and the full 
lips, and the 
self-consciousness 
dropped 
away from her 
with a relief 
that was physical 
in its simplicit
y . She smiled 
broadly. "It's good to see 
you ." What she wanted to say 
was, "I love 
you ." 
During the first half of the meal Jolene talked about 
Methuen-about 
sleeping 
through 
chapel and hating the 
food and about 
Mr. Schell, Miss Graham and the Saturday 
Christian 
movies. She was hilarious 
on the subject of Mrs. 
Deardorff, 
imitating 
her tight voice 
and her way of tossing 
her head. She ate slowly 
and laughed 
a lot, and Beth found 
herself 
laughing 
with her. It had been a long time since 
Beth had laughed, and she had 
never felt so easy with 
anyone-not even with 
Mrs. Wheatley
. Jolene 
ordered 
a 
glass of white wine with 
her veal and Beth hesitated 
before 
asking 
the waiter 
for ice 
water. 
" You not old enough?" 
Jolene 
said. 
"That's not it. I'm eighteen
. " 
Jolene 
raised 
her eyebrows 
and went back to her 
veal. 
After a few moments she started 
talking 
again. "When 
you went off to your happy home, I started 
doing serious 
volleyball
. I graduated when I was eighteen 
and the UniÂ­
versity 
gave me a scholarship in Phys. Ed. " 
" How do you like it?" 
"It's all right, " Jolene 
said, a bit fast. And then, "No, 
it isn't. It' s a shuck is what it is. I don' t want to be a gym 
coach. " 
' ' You could 
do something 
else.' ' 
Jolene 
shook her head. "It wasn't till I got my bacheÂ­
lor's last year that 
I really caught 
on. " She had been 

284 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

talking 
with her mouth 
full. Now she swallowed 
and leaned 
forward with her elbows on 
the table. "I should 
have been 
in Jaw or government. 
These are the right days for 
what 
I've got, and I blew it on learning 
the side straddle 
hop 
and the 
major muscles 
of the abdomen. " Her voice got 
lower and stronger. 
' 'I'm a black woman. I'm an orphan. 
I ought to be at 
Harvard. I ought to be getting 
my picture 
in Time magazine 
like you . " 
"You ' d look great with Barbara Walters, " Beth said. 
" You could talk 
about the emotional 
deprivation 
of 
orphans. " 
"Could I ever , " Jolene said. "I'd like to tell about 
Helen Deardorff and her goddamn tranquilizers. ' ' 
Beth hesitated a moment. 
Then she said, ' 'Do you still 
take tranquil
izers?" 
"No , " Jolene 
said. "Hell, no. " She laughed. "Never 
forget you ripping off that 
whole jarful. Right there in the 
Multi-Purpose Room in front of the whole fucking orphanage, 
with Old Helen 
ready to tum into a 
pillar of salt and the 
rest of us with our jaws 
hanging 
slack .' ' She laughed 
again. 
" Made you a hero, 
it did. I told the new ones about 
it after you 
was gone . " Jolene 
had finished her 
meal; she 
sat back from the table now and pushed the plate toward 
the center. 
Then she leaned back, 
took a package 
of Kents 
from her jacket pocket and looked at it for a moment. 
" When your picture came 
out in Life, I was the one put it 
on the bulletin 
board in the library. Still 
there as far as I 
know. " She lit a 
cigarette, using a little 
black lighter, 
and 
inhaled 
deeply. " 'A Girl Mozart Startles 
the World 
of 
Chess. ' My, my. " 
" I still 
take tranquil
izers, " Beth said. "Too many of 
them. " 

285 

WALTER TEVIS 

"Oh, you poor thing, " Jolene 
said wryly, 
looking 
at her 
cigarette
. 
Beth was quiet for a while. The silence 
between 
them 
was palpabl
e. Then she said, "Let's have dessert. " 
"Chocolate mousse, " Jolene said. During dessert she 
stopped 
eating 
and looked across the table. " You don' t 
look good, Beth , " she said
. "You're puffy." Beth nodded 
and finished 
her mousse. 
Jolene 
drove her home in her silver 
VW. When they got 
to Janwell, Beth said, "I'd like you to come in for 
a 
while, Jolene. I want you to see 
my house. " 
" Sure , " Jolene said. Beth showed her where to pull 
over, and when they got out 
of the car Jolene 
said, "That 
whole house belong to you?" and Beth said, " Yes . " 
Jolene laughed. 
" You're no orphan, " she said
. "Not 
anymore . ' ' 
But when they came into the little 
entryway 
inside 
the 
front door, the stale, 
fruity smell was a shock. Beth had 
not noticed it 
before. There was an embarrassed 
silence 
while she turned on the lamps 
in the living 
room and 
looked 
around. She had not seen the 
dust on the TV screen 
or the 
stains 
on the cobbler's bench. At the comer of the 
living-r
oom ceiling 
near the staircase 
was a dense 
cobweb. 
The whole place was 
dark and musty. 
Jolene walked around the room, looking. " You been 
doing more than pills, 
honey, " she said. 
"I've been drinking 
wine." 
"I believe 
it. " 
Beth made them coffee in the kitchen. At least the floor 
in there was clean. 
She opened the window out into the 
garden to let fresh air 
in. 
Her chessboa
rd was still 
set up 
on the table and Jolene 

286 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

picked up the white queen and held it for a moment. 
' ' I get 
tired of games, " she said. "Never did learn this one." 
"Want me to teach you?" 
Jolene laughed. 
"It'd be something 
to tell about. " She 
set the 
queen back on the board. "They' ve instructed 
me 
in handball, racquetball 
and paddlebal
l . I play tennis, golf, 
dodgebal
l , and I wrestle. Don't need chess. What I want to 
hear about is all this wine.' ' 
Beth handed her a mug of coffee . 
Jolene 
set it down and got out a cigarette. Sitting 
in the 
drab kitchen 
with her 
bright-navy 
suit and her Afro, she 
was like a 
new center 
in the room. 
"It start 
with the pills?" Jolene 
asked. 
"I used 
to love them, " Beth said. "Really love them. " 
Jolene 
shook her head 
twice, 
from side to side. 
"I haven't had anything 
to drink today, " Beth said 
abruptl
y . "I'm supposed 
to play 
in Russia 
next year." 
"Luchenko, " Jolene 
said. " Borgov. " 
Beth was surprised 
that she knew the names. "I'm 
scared 
of it. " 
"Then don't go. " 
"If I don't, there's nothing 
else for me to do. I'll just 
drink. " 
"Looks like you do that, 
anyway. " 
" I just need to quit drinking 
and quit those pills 
and fix 
this place 
up. Look at the grease on that stove. " She 
pointed 
to it. "I've got to study chess eight hours a day, 
and I've got to do some tournaments
. They want me to 
play in San Francisco, 
and they 
want me on the Tonight 
Show. I should 
do all that." 
Jolene 
studied 
her. 

287 

WALTER TEVIS 

" What I want is a drink, " Beth said. " If you weren't 
here, I'd have a bottle 
of wine." 
Jolene frowned. " You sound like 
Susan Hayward in 
those movies, ' ' she said. 
" It's no movie, " Beth said. 
"Then quit talking 
like one. Let me tell 
you what to do. 
You come over 
to the Alumni Gymnasium 
on Euclid 
Avenue tomorrow 
morning at ten. That' s when I work out. 
Bring your gym shoes 
and a pair of shorts. You need to 
get that puffy look out of you before 
you make any more 
plans. " 
Beth stared at 
her. "I always hated gym . . . " 
" I remember, " Jolene 
said. 
Beth thought 
about it. There were bottles 
of red wine 
and white in the cabinet 
behind her, and for a moment she 
became impatient 
for Jolene 
to leave so that she could 
get 
one out and twist the cork off 
and pour herself 
a full glass. 
She could feel the sensation 
of it at 
the back of her throat. 
"It's not 
that bad , " Jolene said. 
" I ' ll get you 
a couple 
of fresh towels 
and you can use my hair dryer.' ' 
" I don't know how to get there. " 
"Take a cab. Hell, walk." 
Beth looked at her, 
dismayed. 
" You've got to get your ass moving, 
girl, " Jolene 
said. 
" You got to quit sitting 
in your own funk. " 
" Okay , " Beth said. " I ' ll be there. " 
When Jolene 
left, Beth had one class of wine but not a 
second. 
She opened 
up all the windows 
in the house and 
drank the 
wine out in the 
backyard
, with the moon_, 
nearly 
ful l , directly 
above the little 
shed at the back. There 
was a 
cool breeze. She took a long 
time over the 
drink, 
letting 
the breeze blow into the kitchen 
window, 
fluttering 
the 

288 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

curtains, blowing 
through 
the kitchen 
and living 
room, 
clearing out the 
air inside. 

The gym was a high-ceilinged 
room with white walls. 
Light came in from enormous 
windows along the side 
where a row of strange-looking 
machines 
sat. Jolene 
was 
wearing 
yellow tights and gym 
shoes. The morning was 
warm, and Beth had 
worn her white shorts 
in the taxi. At 
the far end of the exercise 
room a doleful-looking young 
man in gray trunks 
lay on 
his back on a bench, 
pushing 
up 
weights 
and groaning. Otherwise 
they were alone. 
They started 
with a pair of stationary 
bicycles
. Jolene 
set the drag 
on Beth's at ten, and sixty for her own. By the 
time they 
had pedaled 
ten minutes 
Beth was covered 
with 
sweat and 
her calves 
were aching. 
" It gets 
worse, " Jolene 
said. 
Beth gritted 
her teeth and kept pedaling. 
She could not get 
the rhythm right on the hip-a
nd-back 
machine, and her ass slid on the imitation-l
eather 
bench 
she had 
to lie on while she pushed the weights 
down with 
her legs. Jolene 
had set 
it for forty pounds, but even that 
seemed too much. Then there 
was the machine 
where she 
raised 
the weights 
with her ankles, making the tendons 
in 
her upper legs stand out and hurt. 
After that she had 
to sit 
upright 
in what reminded 
her of an electric 
chair and pull 
in weights 
with her 
elbows. "Firm up your pectorals, " 
Jolene 
said. 
"I thought 
that was a kind of fish, " Beth said. 
Jolene laughed. 
"Trust me, honey. This 
is what you 
need.' ' 
Beth did them all-furious 
and terribly 
out of breath. It 

289 

WALTER TEVIS 

made her fury worse to see 
that Jolene 
used far heavier 
weights 
than she did
. But then, Jolene's figure 
was perfect. 
The shower afterward was exquisite. 
There were strong 
water jets, and Beth sprayed 
herself hard, getting 
the sweat 
the foam 
off. She soaped herself 
thoroughly 
and watched 
swirl on the white tiles 
at her feet as she rinsed 
it off with 
a stinging 
hot spray. 
The woman at the cafeteria 
was handing 
Beth a plate 
with salisbury 
steak on it when Jolene 
pushed her tray up 
next to Beth's. "None of that," Jolene 
said. She took the 
plate and handed it back. "No gravy, " she said, " and no 
potatoes. " 
"I'm not overweig
ht, " Beth said. "It won' t hurt me to 
eat potatoes. ' ' 
Jolene 
said nothing. 
When they pushed their trays past 
the Jell-0 
and Bavarian 
cream pie, Jolene 
shook her head. 
"You ate chocola
te mousse last night," Beth said. 
"Last night was special
, " Jolene 
said. "This is today. " 
They had lunch at eleven-t
hirty because 
Jolene 
had a 
twelve o'clock class. When Beth asked 
her what it was, 
Jolene 
said, "Eastern Europe in the Twentieth 
Century . " 
"Is that part of Phys. Ed. ?" Beth asked. 
"I didn' t tell all of 
it yesterday
. I'm getting 
an M . S . in 
political 
science
. " Beth stared 
said. 
When Beth got up the next morning, her back and 
calves 
were sore, and she decided 
not to go to the gym. 
But when she opened the refrigerator 
to find something 
for 
breakfast, she Â· saw stacks of 
TV dinners 
and suddenly 
thought 
of the way 
Mrs. Wheatley's pale legs had looked 
when she rolled 
down her stockings. She shook her head 
in revulsion 
and started 
prying the 
boxes loose. 
The thought 

at her. "Honi soit qui mal y 

pense," Jolene 

290 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

of frozen fried chicken 
and roast beef 
and turkey 
made her 
ill; she dumped them 
all in a plastic 
shopping 
bag. When 
she opened the 
cabinet 
to look over the canned 
foods, 
there were three bottles 
of Almaden Mountain 
Rhine sitÂ­
ting in front of the cans. She hesitated 
and closed 
the door. 
She would think about that later. 
She had toast and black 
coffee for breakfast. On her way to the 
gym, she dropped 
the sack of frozen dinners 
into the garbage. 
At lunch Jolene 
told her about 
a bulletin 
board in the 
Student 
Union that listed students 
who would do unskilled 
work at 
two dollars an hour. Jolene 
walked her over 
on the 
way to class, and Beth took down two numbers . By 
three 
o'clock that afternoon she 
had a Business Administ
ration 
major beating 
the carpets 
in the backyard and an Art 
History major scrubbing 
the refrigerator 
and kitchen 
cabiÂ­
nets; Beth did 
not supervise 
them; she spent the time 
working 
out variations 
on the Nimzo-Indian 
Defense. 
By the next Monday, she was using all seven of the 
Nautilus machines 
and doing sit-ups 
afterward. On WednesÂ­
day, Jolene 
added ten pounds 
to each of them for her and 
had her 
hold a five-pound 
weight on her chest when she 
did the sit-ups
. The week after that, they 
started 
playing 
handball . Beth was awkward at it and got out of breath 
quickly. 
Jolene 
beat her badly. 
Beth kept at it doggedly, 
panting 
and sweating 
and sometimes 
bruising 
the palm of 
her hand 
on the little black ball. It took 
her ten days and a 
few lucky bounces before 
she won her first game. 
" I knew you'd start winning 
soon enough, " Jolene 
said. They stood in the 
center 
of the court, sweating. 
"I hate losing, " Beth said. 
That day there was a letter waiting 
for her from someÂ­
thing called Christian 
Crusade. 
The stationery 
had about 

291 

WALTER TEVIS 

twenty names down the side, under 
an embossed 
cross. 
The letter 
read: 

Dear Miss Harmon:

to reach you by telephone

She almost 
threw the letter 
away until she remembered 
Benny's saying that he had been given money for his 
Russian 
trip by a church group. She had Benny's phone 
number on a folded 
piece of 
paper in her chess clock box; 
she got it out and dialed. 
Benny answered after the third 
ring. 
"Hi , " she said. "It's 
Beth . " 
Benny was a bit cool, but when she told him about the 
letter, 
he said at once, "Take it. They're 
loaded. "

"Would they pay for my ticket to 
Russia?" 
"More than that. If you ask them, they'll send me 
over 
with you. Separate rooms, considering 
their views. " 
"Why would they pay 
so much money?" 
"They want us to beat the Communists 
for Jesus. 
They're 
the ones who paid part of my way two 
years ago . ' ' He 
paused. "Are you coming back to New York?" His voice 
was carefully neutral. 
"I need to stay in Kentucky a

"Sure , " Benny said. "It sounds all right to me. " 
She wrote Christian 
Crusade that 
afternoon to say that 
she was very much interested 
in their offer and would like 
to take Benjamin Watts with her as 
a second. 
She used the 
pale-blue 
stationery
, crossing 
out " Mrs. Allston 
Wheatley" 
at the top and writing 
in "Elizabeth Harmon. " When she 
walked to the 
comer to mail the letter, 
she decided 
to go 
on downtown 
and buy new sheets 
and pillowcases for the 
bed and a new tablecloth 
for the kitchen . 

m 

The winter 
light i n San Francisco 
was remarkab
le; she had 
never seen anything 
quite like it before. It gave the buildÂ­
ings a preternatural 
clarity of line, and when she climbed 
to the top of Telegraph 
Hill and looked back, she caught 
her breath 
at the sharp focus of 
the houses and 
hotels 
that 
lined the long steep street and 
below them the perfect 
blue 
of the bay. There was a flower 
stand at the comer, and she 
bought 
a bunch of marigolds. Looking 
back at the bay, she 
saw a young couple a block away 
climbing toward her. 
They were clearly 
out of breath 
and stopped 
to rest. Beth 
realized 
with surprise 
that the climb had been easy 
for her.

She decided 
to take long walks during 
her week there. 
Maybe she could find a gym somewhere
. 
When she walked 
up the hill to 
the tournament 
in the 
morning, the air was still 
splendid 
and the colors 
bright, 
but she was tense. The elevator 
in the big hotel was 
crowded. 
Several 
people 
in it 
stared 
at her, and she looked 
away nervously. The man at the desk stopped 
what he was 
doing the minute she walked up. 
" Do I register 
here?" she asked. 
" No need, Miss Harmon. Just go on in. " 
" Which board?" 
He raised 
his eyebrows. " Board One . " 
Board One was 
in a room by itself. 
The table was on a 
three-f
oot-high 
platform, and a display 
board as big as a 
home-movie 
screen stood behind 
it. On each side of the 
table was 
a big swivel 
chair of brown leather 
and chrome. 
It was five minutes 
before starting 
time, and the room was 
jammed with people; 
she had to push her way through 
them to the playing 
space. 
As she did so, 
the buzz of talk 
died down. Everyone 
looked at her. When she climbed the 
steps to the platform, they began to applaud. She tried not 
to let her face show 
anything, 
but she was frightened. The 
last game of chess she had played was five months before, 
and she had lost it. 
She didn' t even know who her opponent 
was; she hadn't 
thought 
to ask. She sat there for a moment with her mind 
nearly empty, and then an arrogant-looking 
young man 
came briskly 
through 
the crowd 
and up the steps. He 
had 
long black hair and a broad, drooping 
mustache. 
She 
recognized 
him from somewhere
, and when he introduced 
himself 
as Andy Levitt, 
she remembered 
the name from 
Chess Review. He seated himself 
stiffly. A tournament 

294 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

director came up to the table and 
spoke quietly 
to Levitt. 
" You can start her clock now . " Levitt 
reached 
out, lookÂ­
ing unconcerned
, and pressed 
the button 
on Beth' s clock. 
She held herself 
steady and played her queen's pawn, 
keeping 
her eyes on the board. 
By the time they had got into 
the middle game, there 
were people jammed in the doorway and someone was 
shushing 
the crowd 
and trying 
to maintain order. She 
had 
never seen so many spectators 
at a match. She turned her 
attention 
back to the board and carefully brought 
a rook to 
an open file. If Levitt 
didn't find a way to prevent 
it, she 
could try attacking 
in three moves. If 
she wasn't missing 
something 
in the position
. She started moving in on him 
cautious
ly, prying 
the pawns 
loose from his castled 
king. 
Then she took a deep breath and brought a 
rook to the 
seventh 
rank. She could hear at the back of her mind the 
voice of the chess bum in Cincinnati years before: 
"Bone 
in the throat, 
a rook on the seventh 
rank. " She looked 
across 
the board at 
Levitt. He looked as if it were indeed a 
chicken 
bone and deeply imbedded. Something 
in her 
exulted , seeing 
him try to hide his confusion. And when 
she followed the rook with her queen
, looking 
brutal 
on 
the seventh 
rank, he 
resigned 
immediat
ely. The applause 
in the room 
was loud and enthusiast
ic. When she came 
down from the platform she was smiling
. There were 
people waiting 
with old copies 
wanting 
her to autograph 
her picture 
on the cover. 
Others wanted 
her to 
sign their programs 
or just sheets of 
paper. 
While she was signing 
one of the magazines, she looked 
for a moment at the black-and-white 
photograph 
of herself 
holding 
the big 
trophy in Ohio, with Benny and Barnes 
and a few others 
out of focus in the background. Her face 

of Chess Review, 

295 

WALTER TEVIS 

looked tired and 
plain, and she 
recalled 
with a sudden 
remembered 
shame that the magazine 
had sat with its tan 
mailing 
cover in a stack on the cobbler's bench for a 
month before she had opened it and found her picture. 
Someone thrust another copy 
at her 
to sign, and she shook 
off the memory. She autographed 
her way out of the 
crowded room and through yet 
another 
crowd that was 
waiting 
outside 
the door, filling the 
space between 
her 
playing area 
and the ballroom 
where the 
rest of the tournaÂ­
ment was still 
in progress. Two directors 
were trying to 
hush the crowd to avoid 
disturbing 
the other games as she 
came through. Some of 
the players looked up from their 
boards angrily 
and frowned in her direction
. It was exhilaÂ­
rating 
and frightening, 
having all these people 
pressed 
near 
her, pushing 
up to her 
with admiration. One of the women 
who had got her autograph 
said, "I don' t know a thing 
about chess, 
dear, but I ' m thrilled for 
you, " and a middleÂ­
aged man insisted 
on shaking 
her hand, saying, " You're 
the best thing 
for the game since Capablanca. 
' ' ' 'Thanks, ' ' 
she said. ' 'I wish i t were as easy for me.' ' Maybe i t is, she 
thought. 
Her brain seemed to be all right. Maybe she 
hadn't ruined 
it. 
She walked confidently 
down the street 
to her hotel in 
bright 
sunshine. 
She would be going to Russia in six 
months. Christian Crusade 
had agreed to buy tickets 
on 
Aeroflot 
for her and Benny and a woman from the USCF 
and would pay their hotel bills. 
The Moscow 
tournament 
would provide 
the meals. She had been 
studying 
chess for 
six hours a day, and she 
could keep it up. She stopped 
to 
buy more flowers-c
arnations 
this time. The woman at the 
desk had asked 
for her autograph 
last night when she came 
in from dinner; 
she would be glad to get her another 
vase. 

296 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

Before leaving 
for California, Beth had mailed 
off checks 
for subscriptions 
to all the magazines 
Benny took. She 
would be getting 
the oldest 
chess 
magazine, and British 
and, from Russia, 

Deutsche Schachzeitung, 
Chess Magazine 
v USSR. There would be Echecs Europe and 
Shakhmatni 
American Chess 

Bulletin. She planned 
to play 
through 
every grandmaster 
game in them, and when she found 
games that were important she would memorize 
them and 
analyze 
every move that had consequence 
or developed 
any idea that she was not familiar 
with. In early spring 
she 
might go to New York and play the U . S . Open and get in 
a few weeks with Benny. The flowers in 
her hand glowed 
crimson, her new jeans and cotton 
sweater 
felt fresh on 
her 
skin in the cool San Francisco 
air, at the bottom 
of the 
street 
the blue 
ocean lay like a 
dream of possibility. 
Her 
soul sang silently 
with it, reaching 
out toward the Pacific. 

When she came home with 
her trophy and the first-prize 
check, she 
found in the pile of mail two business enveÂ­
lopes: 
one was from the USCF and contained 
a check for 
four hundred 
dollars and a 
brief apology 
that they 
couldn't 
send more. The second was from Christian 
Crusade. It had 
a three-page 
letter 
that spoke of the need to promote 
international understanding through 
Christian 
principles and 
to annihilate 
Communism 
for the advancement 
of those 
same principles. The word "His" was capitalized 
in a way 
that made Beth uneasy. 
The letter was 
signed " Yours in 
Christ" 
by four people. Folded up in it was a check for 
four thousand 
dollars. She held the check in her hand for 
a 
long time. Her prize 
money at San Francisco 
was two 
thousand, 
and she had to 
take her travel 
expenses 
out of it. 
Her bank account had been dwindling for the 
past six 

297 

WALTER TEVIS 

months. She had hoped to get at most two thousand 
dollars 
from the people 
in Texas. Whatever 
crazy ideas they might 
have, the 
money was a gift from heaven. 
She called 
Benny 
to tell him the good 
news. 

When she came in from her Wednesday 
morning squash 
game the phone was ringing. She got 
her raincoat 
off in a 
hurry, threw it on the sofa and picked up the phone. 
It was 
a woman' s voice. 
"Is this Elizabeth Harmon?" 
" Yes . " 
"This is Helen Deardorff, at Methuen. " She was too 
astonished 
to speak. "I have something 
to tell you
, ElizaÂ­
beth . Mr. Shaibel 
died last night. 
I thought 
you might 
want to know. ' ' 
She had a sudden image of the fat old j anitor bent over 
his chess set in the basem
ent, with the bare light bulb over 
his head, and herself 
standing 
by him, watching 
the delibÂ­
erateness, the oddness of him there 
alone by the furnace. 
" Last night?" 
she said. 
"A heart atta
ck. He was in his sixties
. " 
What Beth 
said next surprised 
her. It came out 
almost 
without 
conscious 
thought. 
"I'd like to come to the funeral. " 
"The funeral?" Mrs. Deardorff said. ' 'I'm not sure 
when-There' s an unmarried 
sister, 
Hilda Shaibel. You 
could call her.' ' 

When the Wheatleys 
drove her 
to Lexington 
six years 
before, they had gone on narrow asphalt 
roads through 
towns where she had stared 
out the car windows 
at stopÂ­
lights 
while brightly 
dressed 
people 
crossed 
the streets 
and 
walked on crowded sidewalks in 
front of shops. Now
, 
driving 
back with Jolene, 
it was 
four-lane 
concrete most of 

298 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

the way and the 
towns were visible only 
as names printed 
on green signs. 
"He looked like a mean son of 
a bitch, " Jolene 
said. 
"He wasn't easy to play chess with, either. 
I think I was 
terrified 
of him.' ' 
" I was scared of all of 'em , " Jolene 
said. " MotherÂ­
fuckers. ' ' 
That surprised 
Beth. She had imagined 
Jolene 
as fearÂ­
less. " What about Fergussen?" 
"Fergussen 
was an oasis in the desert , " Jolene said, 
' 'but he frightened 
me when he first came. He 
turned out 
to be okay." She smiled. " Old Fergussen. " 
Beth hesitated 
a moment. 
"Was there ever anything 
between 
you two?'' She remembered 
those extra green 
pills. 
Jolene 
laughed. "Wishful 
thinking
. " 
"How old were you when you came?" 
"Six . " 
"Do you know anything 
about your parents?" 
"Just my grandmother
, and she ' s dead. Somewhere 
near Louisville. I don' t want to know anything 
about 
them. I don' t care whether 
I'm a bastard 
or why it was 
they wanted 
to put me with my grandmother 
or why she 
wanted to shove me off on Methuen. I ' m just glad to be 
free of it all. I ' ll have my master's in August, 
and I ' m 
leaving 
this state 
for good. " 
" I still 
remember 
my mother , " Beth said. "Daddy' s 
not s o clear. 
' ' 
" Best to forget 
it, " Jolene 
said. " If you can . " 
She pulled 
into the left lane and passed 
a coal truck and 
two campers. Up ahead a green sign gave 
the mileage 
to 
Mount Sterl
ing. It was spring, almost exactly 
a year since 

299 

WALTER TEVIS 

Beth's last trip in a car, with Benny. She thought 
of the 
griminess 
of the Pennsylvania 
Turnpike. 
This white 
conÂ­
crete road was fresh and new , with Kentucky 
fields and 
white fences and fannhouses on either side 
of it. 
After a while Jolene 
lit up 
a cigarette, and Beth said, 
" Where will you go when you graduate
?" 
She was 
beginning 
to think that Jolene 
hadn't heard her 
when Jolene spoke. 
"I've got an offer from a white law 
firm in Atlanta 
that looks promising
. ' ' She fell silent 
again. 
' ' What they want 
is an imported 
nigger 
to stay even 
with the times. ' ' 
Beth looked at her. " I don' t think 
I'd go any farther 
south if I was black . ' ' 
" Well, you sure ain't," Jolene 
said. "These people 
in 
Atlanta 
will pay me twice what I could get in New 
York. 
I'd be doing public 
relation
s , which is the kind of 
shuck I 
understand 
right to 
my finger
tips, and the
y'll start me out 
with two windows 
in my office and 
a white girl to type my 
letters
. " 
"But you haven't studied 
law . " 
Jolene 
laughed. 
' 'I expect they like i t that way . Fine, 
Slocum and Livingston 
don' t want 
any black female reÂ­
viewing 
torts. What they want is a clean black 
woman 
with a nice ass and a good vocabula
ry. When I did the 
interview 
I dropped 
a lot of words 
like 'reprehensible' 
and 
'dichotomy
, ' and they picked right up. " 
"Jolene , ' ' Beth said, "you're too smart for that. You 
could teach at the University
. And you're 
a fine athlete 
. . . " 
"I know what 
I'm doing , ' ' Jolene 
said. " I play good 
tennis 
and golf and I'm ambitious. " She took a deep drag 
on her cigarette. " You may have no 
idea just how ambi-

300 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

tious I 
am. I worked hard at sports, 
and I had coaches 
promising 
I ' d be a pro if I kept at it. " 
"That doesn
't sound bad . " 
Jolene let the smoke 
out slowly. " Beth , " she said, 
"what I want 
is what you ' ve got. I don't want to work on 
my backhand 
for two years so I can be a bush 
league 
pro. 
You' ve been the bestâ¢at 
what you do for so long you don't 
know what it's like for the rest of us. " 
"I'd like to be half as good-looking 
as you are . . . " 
"Quit giving 
me that," Jolene 
said. "Can ' t spend your 
life in front of 
a mirror. 
You ain ' t ugly anymore anyhow. 
What I'm talking 
about is your 
talent. 
I'd give my ass to 
play tennis 
the way you 
play chess . ' ' 
The conviction 
in Jolene' s voice was 
overwhelming. 
Beth looked at her 
face in profile, with its Afro 
grazing 
at 
the top of the car interior, 
at her smooth brown arms out to 
where her steady 
hands held the wheel, at the anger cloudÂ­
ing her face, and said nothing. 
A minute later 
Jolene 
said, "Well , now. There it is. " 
About a mile ahead 
to the right of the road stood 
three 
dark brick buildings 
with black roofs and black window 
shutters
. The Methuen 
Home for Orphaned 
Children
. 

A yellow-
painted 
wooden stairway 
at the end of a concrete 
path led to the building
. Once the steps had looked broad 
and imposing 
to her, and the 
tarnished brass plaque had 
seemed a stern warning. Now it looked like only the 
entrance 
to a shabby provincial institution. 
The paint on 
the steps 
was peeling. 
The bushes that flanked 
them were 
grubby, and their leaves 
were covered 
with dust. Jolene 
was in the playground, looking 
over the rusty swings and 
the old slide that they 
had not been allowed 
to use except 

301 

WALTER TEVIS 

when Fergussen 
was there 
to supervise. Beth stood on the 
path in the sunlight, 
studying 
the wooden 
doors. Inside 
was Mrs. Deardorf
f's big office and the other offices and , 
filling one whole wing, the library and the chapel . There 
were two classrooms 
in the other wing, and past them was 
the door at the end of the hallway 
that led to the basement. 
She had 
come to accept 
the Sunday-morning chess 
games 
as her prerogative. 
Until that day. It 
still 
constricted 
her 
throat to remember 
the silent 
tableau 
following 
Mrs. 
Deardorff's voice 
shouting 
"Elizabeth! n and the cascade 
of pills 
and fragmented 
glass. Then no more chess. 
Instead 
it had been the full hour and a half of chapel and Beth 
helping 
Miss Lonsdale 
with the chairs 
and listening 
to her 
give her Talks
. It took another 
hour after putting 
the chairs 
away to write 
the precis 
Mrs. Deardorff 
had assigned. 
She 
did it every Sunday for a year, and Mrs. Deardorff reÂ­
turned it every Monday with red marks and some grim 
exhortation 
like "Rewrite. Faulty organiza
tion. 
n She'd 
had to 
look up " Communismn 
in the library for the first 
precis. Beth had felt somewhere in her that Christianity 
ought to have something 
more to it. 
Jolene had come 
over and was standing 
beside her, 
squinting in 
the sunlight. 
"That's where you learned to 
play?'' 
" In the basement. 
n 
" Shit, n Jolene said. "They should have encouraged 
you. Sent you on more exhibitions 
after that one. They 
like publicity, 
just like anybody 
else.' ' 
" Publicity?n 
She was feeling dazed. 
" It brings 
in money. n 
She had never thought 
of anyone there encouraging 
her. 
It began to enter her mind now, standing 
in front of the 

302 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

building
. She could 
have played 
in tournaments 
at nine or 
ten, like Benny. She had been bright 
and eager, 
and her 
mind was voracious 
in its appetite for 
chess. She could 
have been playing 
grandmasters 
and learning 
things 
that 
people 
like Shaibel 
and Ganz could never teach her. Girev 
was planning 
at thirteen 
to be World Champion. If she had 
had half his chances, she would have been as good at ten. 
For a moment the 
whole autocratic 
institution 
of Russian 
chess merged in her mind with the autocracy 
of the place 
where she was now standing. 
Institut
ions. There was no 
violation 
of Christianity 
in chess, any more than 
there was 
a violation 
of Marxism. It was nonideological
. It wouldn' t 
have hurt 
Deardorff to let her play-to encourage her to 
play. It would have 
been something for 
Methuen 
to boast 
about. 
She could see Deardorf
f' s face in her mind-the 
thin, rouged cheeks, the tight, 
reproving 
smile, the little 
sadistic 
glint in 
her eyes. It had pleased 
her to cut Beth 
off 
from the game she 
loved. It had pleased 
her. 
" You want to go in?" Jolene 
asked. 
"No. Let's find that motel. " 
The motel had a small pool only a few yards from the 
road, with some 
weary-looking maples beside 
it. The 
evening 
was warm enough 
for a quick 
swim after dinner. 
Jolene 
turned out to be a superb 
swimmer, 
going back and 
forth the length 
of the pool 
with hardly a ripple, while 
Beth treaded 
water under 
the diving 
board. Jolene 
pulled 
up near her. "We were chicken, " she said. "We should 
have gone in the Administration 
Building
. We should 
have 
gone in her office. " 
The funeral was in the morning at the Lutheran Church
. 
There were a dozen people 
and a closed 
casket. 
It was an 
ordinary-sized 
coffin, and Beth wondered briefly 
how they 

303 

WALTER TEVIS 

could fit a man of Shaibel's girth into it. Although 
the 
church was smaller, 
it was much like Mrs. Wheatley's 
funeral in Lexington. 
After the first 
five minutes 
of it, she 
was bored and restles
s , and Jolene 
was dozing. After the 
ceremony they 
followed 
the small procession 
to the grave. 
" I remember, " Jolene said, "he scared shit out of 
me 
once, hollering to keep off the library 
floor. 
He just mopped 
it, and Mr. Schell 
sent me in to get a book. Son 
of a bitch 
hated kids . ' ' 
"Mrs. Deardorff wasn't at the church. " 
"None of them were." 
The graveside 
service was 
an anticlimax. 
They lowered 
the coffin, and the 
minister said a prayer. 
Nobody cried. 
They looked like people waiting 
in line at a teller's winÂ­
dow at the bank. Beth and Jolene 
were the 
only young 
ones there, 
and none of the others 
spoke to them. They left 
immediately 
after it was 
over, walking 
along a narrow path 
in the old cemetery
, past faded gravestones 
and patches 
of 
dandelions. Beth felt no 
grief for the dead man, no sadness 
that he was gone. The only thing she felt was guilt 
that she 
had never sent him his ten dollars-she 
should 
have mailed 
him a check years ago. 
They had to pass Methuen 
on the way 
back to 
LexingÂ­
ton. Just before the turnoff, 
Beth said, "Let's go in. 
There' s something 
I want to see, " and Jolene 
turned the 
car down the 
drive to the orphana
ge. 
Jolene 
stayed in the car. Beth got out and pushed her 
way into the side door of 
the Administration 
B uilding. It 
was dark and cool inside. 
Straight 
in front of her was a 
door that read 
HELEN DEARDORFF-SUPERINTENDENT. She 
walked down the empty 
hallway to the 
doorway 
at the end. 

304 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

When she pushed it open, there was a light on below. She 
went slowly down the 
steps. 
The chessboard and pieces 
weren' t there, 
but the table 
he had played 
on still 
sat by the furnace, and his unpainted 
chair was still 
in position
. The bare bulb over it was on. 
She stood 
looking 
down at 
the table . Then she seated 
herself 
thoughtf
ully in Mr. Shaibel's chair and looked up 
and saw something 
she had not seen before. 
Behind the place where she used to sit to play was a 
kind of rough partition 
made of unplaned wooden boards 
nailed 
to two-by-f
ours. A calendar 
used to hang there, 
with scenes from 
Bavaria above the sheets 
for the months. 
Now the calendar 
was gone and the entire 
partition 
was 
covered 
with photographs 
and clippings 
and covers from 
each of them neatly 
taped to the wood and 
covered 
with clear plastic 
to keep it clean and free of 
dust-the only thing in this dingy basement that was. They 
were pictures 
of her. 
There were printed 
games from Chess 
and newspaper 
pieces 
from the Lexington 
and from some 
magaÂ­
zines in German. The old Life piece was there, 
and next to 
it was the cover of Chess Review with her 
holding 
the U . S . 
Championship 
trophy. Filling 
in the smaller 
spaces were 
newspaper 
pictures, some of them duplicat
es. There must 
have been twenty photogra
phs.

" You find what you were looking 
for?" Jolene asked 
when she got back to the car. 
" More , " Beth said. She started 
to say something 
else 
but didn't. Jolene 
backed the car up, 
drove out of the lot 
and turned back onto the 
road that le,d to the highway. 
When they drove 
up the ramp and pulled 
onto the 

305

interstate
, Jolene 
gunned the VW and it shot ahead. NeiÂ­
ther of 
them looked 
back. Beth had stopped 
crying 
by then 
and was wiping her face with a handkerchief. 
"Didn' t bite off more 
than you could chew, did you?" 
Jolene 
said. 
"No . " Beth blew her 
nose. ' 'I'm fine. " 

The taller 
of the two women looked like Helen Deardorff. 
Or didn' t exactly 
look like her as much as display 
all 
indications 
of spiritual 
sisterhood. She wore a beige suit 
and pumps and smiled 
a good deal in a way totally 
devoid 
of feeling. Her name was Mrs . Blocker. The other was 
plump and slightly 
embarrassed 
and wore a dark floral 
print and no-nonsense 
shoes. She was Miss Dodge. They 
were on their way from Houston 
to Cincinnati 
and had 
stopped 
by for a chat. They sat side by side on Beth ' s sofa 
and talked 
about the ballet 
in Houston 
and the way the city 
was growing 
in culture. 
Clearly 
they wanted Beth to know 
Christian 
Crusade 
was not merely a narrow, fundamentalÂ­
ist organization
. And just as clearly 
they had come to look 
her over. They had written 
ahead. 
Beth listened 
politely 
while they talked about 
Houston 
and about the agency they were helping 
to set up in 
Cincinnati-an agency that had something 
to do with 
proÂ­
tecting 
the Christian 
environment. 
The conversation 
falÂ­
tered for a moment, and Miss 
Dodge spoke. ' 'What we 
would really 
like, Elizabeth, 
would be some kind 
of a 
statement
. " 
" A statement?" 
Beth was sitting 
in Mrs. Wheatley
's 
armchair 
facing them on the sofa. 
Mrs . Blocker picked it up. "Christ
ian Crusade 
would 

306 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

like you to make 
your position 
public. In a world where 
so 
many keep silent 
. . . " She didn't finish. 
"What position?" 
Beth asked. 
"As we know, " Mrs. Dodge said, " the spread 
of ComÂ­
munism is also the spread of atheism.' ' 
" I suppose 
so, " Beth said. 
" It's not a matter of supposing
, " Mrs. Blocker said 
quickly. "It's a matter of fact. Of Marxist-Leninist 
fact. 
The Holy Word is anathema 
to the Kremlin, and 
it is one 
of the major purposes 
of Christian 
Crusade 
to contest 
the 
Kremlin 
and the atheists 
who sit 
there. " 
" I have no quarrel with that, " Beth said. 
"Good. What we want is a statement
. " The way Mrs. 
Blocker said it echoed something 
that Beth had recognized 
years before in Mrs. Deardorf
f' s voice. It was the tone of 
the practiced 
bully. 
She felt the way she did when a player 
brought 
out his queen too soon against 
her. ' 'You want me 
to make 
a statement 
for the press?'' 
"Exactly! " Mrs. Blocker said
. " If Christian 
Crusade 
is 
going to-" She stood and felt the manila 
envelope 
in her 
lap as though 
estimating 
its weight. 
" We had something 
prepared. ' ' 
Beth looked at her, hating 
her and saying 
nothing. 
Mrs. Blocker opened the clasp on the envelope 
and 
pulled 
out a sheet of paper filled 
with typing. She gave it 
to Beth. 
It was the same stationery the 
original 
letter had come 
on, with its list of names running 
down the 
side. Beth 
glanced down the list and 
saw "Telsa R. Blocker, ExecuÂ­
tive Secretary, " just above half a dozen men's names with 
the abbreviation 
"Rev . " in front of them. Then she read 
the statement 
quickly. 
Some phrases 
in it were underlined, 

307 

WALTER TEVIS 

like "the atheist-Communist nexus" 
and "a militant ChrisÂ­
tian Endeavor. " She looked up 

from the paper at Mrs. 
B locker, 
who was 
sitting 
with her knees pressing 
together, 
looking 
around the room with a subdued 
dislike. 
"I'm a 
chess player,' ' Beth said quietly
. 
"Of course you 
are, my dear," Mrs. B locker said. 
" And you're a Christian. 
" 
"I'm not sure of that." 
Mrs. Blocker stared at her. 
" Look , " Beth said, "I 
have no intention 
of saying 
things 
like this
. ' ' 
Mrs. Blocker leaned forward and took the statement. 
" Christian 
Crusade 
has already 
invested 
a good deal 
of 
money . . . 
' ' There was a glint in her eye that Beth had 
seen before. 
Beth stood up. "I'll give it 
back." She walked 
to the 
desk and found her checkbook. For a 
moment she felt like 
a prig and 
a fool. It was money for her air fare and Benny's 
and for the woman from the Federation 
as an escort. It 
would pay her hotel bill and incidental 
expenses 
on the 
trip. B ut at the bottom of the check they had sent her 
a 
month ago, in the place where you normally 
wrote "rent" 
or "light bill " to say what the money 
was for, someoneÂ­
probably 
Mrs. Blocker-had 
written 
" For Christian 
SerÂ­
vice . " Beth made out a check for 
four thousand 
dollars 
to 
Christian 
Crusade, 
and in the space at the bottom she 
wrote ' 'Full refund. ' ' 
Miss Dodge' s voice was surprisingly 
gentle. " I hope 
you know what you're doing, 
dear." She looked 
genuinely 
concerned. 
"I hope so too , " Beth said. Her plane for Moscow left 
in five 
weeks.

She got Benny on 
the phone at the 
first try. " You're 
crazy , ' ' he said 
when she told him. 
" Anyway, I did it," Beth said. "It's too late to undo 
, 
it.'
' 'Are the tickets paid 
for?'' 
"No , " Beth said. "Nothing's paid for. " 
" You have 
to pay Intourist 
for the hotel in advance. " 
" I know that . " Beth did not like Benny
' s tone. "I've 
got two thousand 
in my bank account. 
It would be more, 
but I've been keeping up this 
house. It's going to take 
three thousand 
more to do it. At least that.' ' 
" I don't have it, " Benny said. 
" What do you mean? 
You've got money. " 
"I don ' t have it. " There was a long silence. 
" You can 
call the Federation. Or the State Department
. ' ' 
"The Federation 
doesn' t like me, " Beth said. "They 
think I haven't done as much for chess as I could have. " 
" You should 
"God damn it, Benny, " Beth 
said. "Come off it." 
" You're crazy, " Benny said. " What do you care what 
those dummies 
believe? 
What are you trying 
to prove?" 
"Benny . I don't want to go to Russia 
alone. " 
Benny's voice suddenly 
became loud. " You asshole," 
he shouted. 
" You crazy fucking 
asshole
! " 
"Benny . . . " 
"First you don't come back to New York and then you 
pull this crap. You can fucking well go alone

" Maybe I shouldn't have done it." She was beginning 
to feel a chill inside. 
" Maybe I didn't have to give them 
back the check. "

click. 

" 'Maybe' is a loser's 
word." Benny's voice was like 
ice. 
' 'Benny, I'm sorry.' ' 
"I'm hanging 
up, " Benny 
said. " You were a pain in 
the ass when I first met you, and you're a pain in the ass 
right now. I don't want to 
talk to you anymore.
" The 
phone in her hand went 
She put it back in 
the cradle. 
She had 
blown it. She had lost Benny. 
She called 
the Federation 
and had to 
wait on hold for ten 
minutes 
before the director 
came on the line. He was 
pleasant 
with her and sympathetic 
and wished her well in 
Moscow but said there was no money to be had. ' 'What 
we have 
comes mostly 
from the 
magazine. The four hunÂ­
dred dollars is all we 
can possibly 
spare . " 
It wasn't until the next morning that she got her 
call 
returned from 
Washingt
on. It was somebody 
named 
O 'Malley, from Cultural Affairs . When she told 
him the 
problem, he went on about how excited they 
were, there 
at 
State, 
over her " giving the Russians 
a jolt at their own 
game . ' ' He asked her how he could 
help. 
"I need 
three thousand 
dollars right awa
y . " 
"I'll 
see what 
I can do, " O'Malley 
said. "I'll 
get back 
to you in an hour.' ' 
But it was four hours later that he called 
back. She 
paced around the kitchen and the 
garden and made a quick 
call to Anne Rear
don, who was 
to be the chaperone 
reÂ­
quired by Christian 
Crusade. Anne Reardon 
had a womÂ­
an's rating 
of 1 900 or so 
and at least knew 
the game. Beth 
had wiped her out once somewhere out West, practically 
blasting 
her pieces 
off the board. No one answered 
the 
phone. Beth made herself 
coffee and leafed 
through 
some 
waiting 
for the call.

She felt almost nauseated 
at the way she had 
let the 
Christian 
Crusade 
money go. Four thousand 
dollars-for a 
gesture. Finally 
the phone rang. 
It was O'Malley again. No dice. He was terribly 
sorry, 
but there was no way government 
funds could be handed 
out to her without more 
time and approval. "We'll be 
sending 
one of our men with you, though.' ' 
"Don't you have petty cash or something?" Beth asked. 
"I don't need funds to undermine 
the government 
in MosÂ­
cow. I just need to take some people 
to help me.' ' 
"I'm sorry, " O'Malley said. ' 'I'm really 
sorry . " 
After hanging 
up, she went back out into the garden. 
She would send the check to 
the Washington office of 
Intourist 
in the morni
ng. She would 
go alone, or 
with 
whomever 
the State Department 
found to send with her. 
She had studied 
Russian, 
and she would not 
be totally 
at a 
loss. The Russian 
players 
would speak English, anyway. 
She could do her own training. She had been training 
alone for months. She finished 
off the last of her coffee. 
She had been training 
alone for most of her life .

CHAPTER 1 4 

They had to sit in a waiting 
room at Orly Airport 
for seven 
hours, and 
when the time came to board 
the Aeroflot 
plane, 
a young women in 
an olive-drab uniform had to 
stamp everybo
dy's ticket 
and study everybody
' s passport 
while Beth and Mr. Booth waited at the back of the line 
for another 
hour. But it cheered 
her a bit when she finally 
got to the head 
of the line and the woman 
said, "The chess 
champion! " and smiled broadly 
at her with 
a surprising 
lightening 
of her features . When 
Beth smiled 
back at 
her, 
the woman said, "Good luck! " as though she really 
meant 
it. The woman was, of course, 
Russian. 
No official in 
America would 
have recogniz
ed Beth ' s name. 
Her seat was by a window near the back; it 
had heavy 
brown plastic upholstery and a little white 
antimacassar 
on 
each arm. She got in with Mr. Booth beside her. She 
looked 
out the window at the gray Paris sky with the water

in broad sheets 
on the runways 
and the planes 
gleaming 
darkly in the evening 
wetness. It felt as if she 
were already 
in Moscow. After a few minutes 
a steward 
started 
handing 
out glasses 
of water. 
Mr. Booth drank about 
half of his 
and then fished 
in his jacket 
pocket. 
After some fumbling 
he produced 
a little 
silver 
flask and 
pulled 
the cap off with 
his teeth. He filled the 
glass with whiskey, put the cap 
back on 
and slipped the flask into his pocket. Then he held 
the glass toward Beth in a perfunctory way, and she shook 
her head. It wasn
' t easy to do. She could have used 
a 
drink. 
She did not 
like this 
strange-looking 
airplane, and 
she didn't like the man sitting 
beside 
her. 
She had disliked Mr. Booth from the moment he met 
her at Kennedy 
and introduced 
himself. 
Assista
nt to the 
Undersecr
etary. Cultural Affairs . He would 
show her the 
ropes in Moscow. She did not 
want to be shown any 
ropes-especially 
not by this gravelly 
voiced 
old man with 
his dark suit, 
arched eyebrows 
and frequent 
theatri
cal laughÂ­
ter. When he volunteered 
the information 
that he had 
played chess at Yale in the forties, she said 
nothing; 
he 
had spoken of it as though it were a shared perversion. 
What she 
wanted was to be traveling 
with Benny Watts. 
She hadn' t even been 
able to 
get hold of Benny the night 
before; his line was busy the first two times she 
dialed 
and 
then there was 
no answer. 
She had a letter 
from the 
director 
of the USCF wishing 
her well and that was all . 
She leaned back against 
the seat, closed her eyes and 
tried to relax, tuning out the voices, Russian, 
German 
and French, that surrounded 
her. In a pocket of her hand 
luggage 
was a bottle 
with thirty green pills; she had 
not 
taken one for over six months, but she would have one on 
this airplane 
if necessary. It would certainly 
be better 
than 

3 1 3 

WALTER TEVIS 

drinking. 
She needed to rest. The long wait at the airport 
had left her nerves jagged. 
She had tried twice to get 
Jolene 
on the phone, but there was no answer. 
What she really 
needed was Benny Watts here with her. 
If she 
hadn' t been such a fool, giving 
back that 
money, 
taking a 
stand on something 
she hadn't really cared about. 
That wasn' t so. It wasn' t being an asshole 
to refuse 
to be 
bullied
, to call 
that woman's bluff. But she needed Benny. 
For a moment 
she let herself 
imagine 
traveling with D . L . 
Townes, the two o f them staying 
together 
in Moscow. B ut 
that was no good. 
She missed Benny, not Townes. She 
missed Benny' s quick and sober mind, his j udgment and 
tenacity
, his knowledge of chess and 
his knowledge of 
her. 
He would be 
in the seat beside 
her, and they could talk 
chess, 
and in Moscow after her games they would 
analyze 
the play and then plan for the next opponent. They would 
eat their meals 
together 
in the hotel
, the way she had done 
with Mrs. Wheatley. They could see Moscow, and whenÂ­
ever they wanted to they could make 
love at their hotel. 
B ut Benny was in New York, and she was in a dark 
airplane flying toward Eastern 
Europe. 
By the time they came down through 
the heavy clouds 
and she had her first sight of Russia, 
which looked from 
above as much like Kentucky 
as anything 
else, she had 
taken three of the pills, slept fitfully for a few hours and 
was feeling the glassy-eyed 
numbness 
that she used to feel 
after a long trip on a Greyhound 
bus. She remembered 
taking 
the pills 
in the middle of the night. 
She had walked 
down an aisle full of sleeping 
people 
to the rest room and 
got water in a funny-looking 
little plastic 
glass. 
Mr. Booth did tum out to 
be a help in customs. His 
Russian 
was good, and he got her into the right booth for 

3 1 4 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

the inspection
. What was surprising 
was the ease of 
it all ; 
a pleasant 
old man in uniform went casually 
through 
her 
luggage, 
opened her two bags, poked around 
a bit and 
closed 
them. That was it. 
When they came through 
the gate, a limousine 
from the 
embassy was waiting. 
They drove through 
fields where 
men and women were working 
in early-morning 
sunlight, 
and at one place along the road 
she saw three enormous 
tractors
, far bigger 
than anything 
she had seen in America, 
driving 
slowly across 
a field that stretched 
as far 
as she 
could see. There was very little 
other traffic 
on the road . 
The car started 
moving through 
rows of six-
and eight-story 
buildings 
with tiny windows an
d, since it was a warm June 
morning even 
under the gray sky, people sitting on 
the 
doorste
ps. Then 
the road began to broaden, and they drove 
past a small green park and another 
large one and past 
some enor
mous, newer buildings 
that looked 
as if 
they had 
been built 
to last forever. The traffic 
had become 
heavier 
and there were 
people on bicycles 
at one side of 
the road 
now and a great many pedestrians 
on the sidewalks. 
Mr. Booth was leaning 
back in his rumpled 
suit with his 
eyes half closed. Beth sat stiffly in the back of the long 
car, looking 
out the window on her side. There was nothÂ­
ing threatening 
about the way Moscow looked; 
she could 
have been 
entering 
any large city. But she could not loosen 
up inside. The 
tournament 
would start the next morning. 
She felt totally alone, 
and frightened. 

Her teacher 
at the University had 
talked 
about how 
Russians 
drank tea from glasses
, straining 
it through 
a lump of sugar 
held between 
the teeth , 
but the tea served 
in this big dark 
parlor 
of a room was in thin china cups with a Greek key

design 
in gold. She sat in her high-backed 
Victorian chair 
with her 
knees pressed 
together, 
holding the 
saucer 
with 
the cup and a hard little 
roll on 
it and tried to listen 
attentively 
to the director. 
He spoke a few sentences 
first 
in English 
and then in French. Then English 
again: 
the 
visitors 
were welcome 
in the Soviet 
Union; games would 
begin promptly 
at ten o'clock 
each morning; a referee 
would be assigned 
to each board and 
should 
be consulted 
in the event 
of any irregularity. 
There would 
be no smokÂ­
ing or eating 
during 
play. An attendant 
would accompany 
players to the rest rooms should 
the need arise. It would be 
proper 
to raise one's right hand in such 
an event. 
The chairs were 
in a circle, and the director was on 
Beth ' s right. 
Across from her sat Dimitri Luchenko, 
Viktor 
Laev and Leonid Shapkin, 
all dressed 
in well-tailo
red suits 
and wearing 
white shirts 
and dark ties. Mr. Booth 
had said 
Russian 
men dressed 
as though their clothes 
came from a 
nineteen-thirties 
Montgomery Ward catalogue, 
but these 
men were soberly 
dapper in expensive 
gray gaberdine 
and 
worsted. Those 
three alone-Luchen
ko, Laev and Shapkin--Â­
were a small pantheon 
next to which the entire 
establishÂ­
ment of American 
chess would stammer 
in humiliation. 
And on her left was Vasily 
Borgov. She could not bring 
herself 
to look at him, but she could smell his 
cologne. 
Between 
him and the other 
three Russians was an only 
slightly 
lesser 
pantheon
-Jorge Flento 
from Brazil, Bernt 
Hellstrom 
from Finland 
and Jean-Paul 
Duhamel 
from BelÂ­
gium, also wearing 
conservative 
suits. She sipped her 
tea 
and tried to appear calm. There were heavy maroon draÂ­
peries 
at the tall windows, 
and the chairs 
were upholst
ered 
in maroon velvet 
trimmed 
with gold. It was nine-thirty 
in 
the morning and the summer day outside 
was splendid, 
but 

3 1 6 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

the draperies 
here were 
tightly 
closed. The Oriental 
carpet 
on the floor 
looked as if it had come from a museum. 
The 
walls were paneled 
in rosewood. 
An escort 
of two women had brought 
her here from the 
hotel; 
she had shaken hands with the other players, and 
they had been seated 
like this 
for a half hour. 
In her huge, 
strange 
hotel room 
the night before a 
water tap was dripÂ­
ping somewhere
, and she had barely slept. 
She had been 
dressed in her 
expensive 
navy-blue 
tailored dress since 
seven-thir
ty, and she could feel herself perspiring; 
her 
nylons 
encased 
her legs 
in a warm grip. She could hardly 
have felt more out of place. Every 
time she glanced 
at the 
men around her, they smiled 
faintly. She felt like a child at 
an adult social 
function. Her head ached. She would have 
to ask the 
director for 
aspirin. 
And then quite 
suddenly 
the director 
finished 
his speech, 
and the 
men stood up. Beth jumped to her 
feet, rattling her 
cup on its saucer. 
The waiter 
in a white cossack 
blouse 
who had served the tea came running 
up to take it from 
her. Borgov, 
who had ignored 
her except 
for a perfunctory 
handshake at the beginning, 
ignored 
her now as he crossed 
in front of her and walked out the door the director 
had 
opened. The others 
followed, 
with Beth behind Shapkin 
and in front of 
Hellstrom. As they filed 
out the door into 
a 
carpeted hallway , Luchenko 
stopped 
for a moment and 
turned to her. ' 'I'm delighted 
you are here , " he said. " I 
look forward keenly to playing 
you . " He had long white 
hair like an orchestra 
conductor's and wore an impeccable 
silvery 
necktie
, beautif
ully knotted 
under a starched 
white 
collar. 
The warmth in his face was unquestionable. 
"Thank 
you, " she said. She had read of Luchenko 
in Junior 
High; 
Chess Review wrote of him with the kind of awe that Beth 

3 1 7 

WALTER TEVIS 

felt now. He had been World Champion 
then, losing 
to 
Borgov in a long match several 
years ago. 
They walked 
down the hall a good distance 
before the 
director stopped 
at another 
door and opened it. 
Borgov 
went in first, and the others 
followed. 
They were in some kind of anteroom 
with a closed 
door 
on the far side. Beth could hear a 
distant wave 
of sound, 
and when 
the director 
walked over and opened the door the 
sound became louder. 
Nothing 
was visible 
except a dark 
curtain , but when she could see around it, she sucked in 
her breath . 
She was facing a vast auditorium 
filled 
with 
people. It was like the view from the stage of Radio City 
Music Hall 
might be with every seat filled. The crowd 
stretched 
back for hundreds 
of yards, and the aisles had 
folding chairs 
set up in them with small groups clustered 
together 
talking
. As the players came across the wide 
carpeted stage, 
the sound died. Everyone stared 
at them. 
Up above the main floor was a broad balcony, with 
a huge 
red banner draped across 
it, and above this was row after 
row of more faces. 
On the stage were four large tables, each the size of a 
desk, each clearly 
new and inlaid 
with a 
large chessboard 
on which the pieces 
were already 
set up. To the right 
of 
each position 
for Black sat an oversized
, wooden-cased 
chess clock, 
and to White's right, a large pitcher 
of water 
and two 
glasses
. The high-backed swivel 
chairs 
were set 
up so the players would be visible 
in profile from the 
audience. 
Behind each of them stood a male referee 
in a 
white shirt and black bow tie, and behind each 
referee 
was 
a display 
board with the 
pieces 
in their opening 
position
. 
The lighting 
was bright 
but indirect, 
coming from a lumiÂ­
nous ceiling 
above the 
playing 
area. 

3 1 8 

THE QUEEN'S

The director 
smiled at 
Beth, took her by the hand and 
led her out to the 
center 
of the stage. 
There was no sound 
at all in 
the auditor
ium. The director 
spoke into an oldÂ­
fashioned 
microphone 
on a stand at center 
stage. Although 
he was speaking 
in Russian, Beth understood 
the words 
" chess" and "the United States" and finally her name: 
Elizabeth Hannon. The applause 
was sudden, warm and 
thunderous; she felt it as a 
physical 
thing. 
The director 
escorted 
her to the 
chair at the far end and 
seated 
her at the 
black piec
es. She watched 
as he brought 
out each of the 
other foreign players for a short introduction 
and applause. 
Then came the Russians
, beginning 
with Laev. The apÂ­
plause 
became deafening, and when he got to the 
last of 
them, Vasily Borg
ov, it went on and on. 
Her opponent 
for the first game was Laev. He was 
seated 
across 
from her during the ovation 
for Borgov, 
and 
she glanced 
at him while it was going on. Laev was in his 
twentie
s . There was a tight smile on his 
lean and youthful 
face, his brow was heavy with annoyance 
and with the 
fingers 
of one slim hand he was drumming 
inaudibly 
on 
the table. 
When the 
applause 
died down, the director, 
flushed 
with 
the excitement, 
went to 
the table where Borgov was playing 
the white pieces 
and smartly 
punched 
the clock. Then he 
walked to 
the next table and 
did the 
same thing, 
and to the 
next. At Beth's he smiled 
importantly 
at the 
two of them 
and crisply 
pushed the button on Beth's side, starting 
Laev's clock. 
Laev sighed quietly 
and moved his king pawn to 
the 
fourth ra
nk. Beth without 
hesitation 
moved her queen 
bishop 
pawn, relieved 
to be just playing 
chess. The pieces 
were large and solid; they stood out with a comforting 

3 1 9 

WALTER TEVIS 

clarity 
on the board, each of them exactly 
centered 
in its 
home square, 
each sharply 
outlined, 
cleanly 
turned, finely 
burnished. 
The board had a matte finish 
with a brass inlay 
around its outer perimeter. 
Her chair was substantial 
and 
soft, yet firm; she adjusted herself in it 
now, feeling its 
comfort, 
and watched 
Laev play the king' s knight 
to bishop 
three. She picked 
up her queen' s knight, 
enjoying the 
heaviness 
of the piece, 
and set 
it on queen bishop three. 
Laev played 
pawn to queen four; she took with her pawn
, 
setting 
his to the right of the clock. 
The referee, his 
back 
to them, repeated 
each move on the big board. There was 
still 
a tightness 
in her shoulders, 
but she began to relax. It 
was Russia 
and it was strange, but it 
was still ch
ess. 
She knew 
Laev' s style from the bulletins 
she had 
been 
studying, 
and she felt certain 
that if she played pawn to 
king four on the sixth move, 
he would follow the Boleslavski 
Variation 
with his knight 
to bishop three 
and then castle 
on 
the kingside. 
He had done that against 
both Petrosian 
and 
Tal, in 1 965. Players sometimes broke 
into strange 
new 
lines at 
important 
tournaments
, lines that might have been 
prepared 
for weeks in advance, but she felt the Russians 
would not have taken that 
trouble 
with her. As far as they 
knew, her level of play was roughly 
that of Benny Watts, 
and men like Laev 
would not devote much time to preparaÂ­
tion for playing 
Benny. She was not an important 
player 
by their standards; the only unusual 
thing about 
her was 
her sex, and even that 
wasn't unique 
in Russia. 
There was 
Nona Gaprindash
vili, 
not up to the level of this tournaÂ­
ment, but a player who had met all 
these Russian 
grandmasters 
many times before. Laev would be expecting 
an easy win. He brought 
the knight 
out and castled 
as she 
had expected. 
She felt sanguine 
about the reading 
she had 

320 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

done over the past six months; 
it was nice to know what to 
expect. She castled
. 
The game gradually 
began to slow as they moved past 
the opening 
without 
any errors 
and into a poised middle 
game with each of them now minus one knight 
and one 
bishop, 
and with the kings 
well protected 
and no holes in 
either position. 
By the eighteenth 
move the board had a 
dangerous 
equilibrium. This was 
not the attack 
chess she 
had made her American 
reputation 
with; it 
was chamberÂ­
music chess, 
subtle 
and intricate. 
Playing 
white, 
Laev still 
had the advantage
. He made 
moves that contained 
cunningly 
deceptive 
threats , 
but she 
parried 
them without losing tempo 
or position. 
On the 
twenty-fourth, she found an opportunity 
for a finesse, 
opening 
a file for her queen rook while forcing him to 
retreat 
a bishop, 
and when she made it, Laev studied 
it for 
a long while and then looked at her in a new way, as 
though he were 
seeing 
her for 
the first time. A quiver 
of 
pleasure went through 
her. He studied 
the board again 
before retreating 
the bishop. 
She brought 
the rook over. 
Now she had equality. 
Five moves later she 
found a way of adding to 
it. She 
pushed a pawn to 
the fifth rank, offering it in sacrifice. 
With the move, as quietly 
pretty as any she had 
ever 
made, Laev was on the defensive. He did not take the 
pawn but was 
forced to 
bring the knight 
it attacked 
back to 
the square in front of his queen. She brought 
her rook to 
the third rank , and he had to respond to 
that. She 
was not 
pushing 
him so much as pressing 
gently. And gradually 
he 
began to yield, trying 
to look unconcerned 
about it. But he 
must have been astonished. 
Russian 
grandmasters 
were not 
supposed 
to have 
this done 
to them by American 
girls. 
She 

3 2 1 

WALTER TEVIS 

kept after him, and finally the point was reached 
where she 
could safely post her remaining knight 
on queen five, 
where he could not dislodge 
it. She put 
it there and, two 
moves later, 
brought 
her rook over to the 
knight file, 
directly 
above his king. He studied 
it for a long time while 
his clock ticked 
loudly and 
then did what 
she had fervently 
hoped he might do; he pushed the king bishop 
pawn up to 
attack 
the rook. When he punched 
his clock, 
he did not 
look at her. 
Without 
hesitation she picked 
up her bishop 
and took his 
pawn with 
it, offering it as sacrifice. When the 
referee 
posted the move she heard 
an audible response 
from the 
spectators 
and whispering. Laev would have to do someÂ­
thing; 
he could not ignore the bishop. 
He began running 
his fingers 
through 
his hair with one hand, drumming 
the 
tips of the others 
on the table. 
Beth leaned back in the 
chair and stret
ched. She had him. 
He studied 
the move for twenty minutes 
on the clock 
before he suddenly 
stood up from the table and held out 
his hand. Beth rose and took it. The audience 
was silent. 
The tournament 
director 
came over 
and shook her 
hand 
too, and she walked 
off the stage with him to sudden, 
shocking 
applause. 

She was supposed to 
have lunch with Mr. Booth and some 
people 
who were coming over from the embassy, 
but when 
she walked into the vast lobby of 
the hotel, which felt like 
a carpeted 
gymnasium 
with Victorian 
armchairs 
lining 
its 
walls, he was not there. The lady at the desk had a 
message 
for her on a sheet 
of paper: "I'm really 
awfully 
sorry, 
but some work has come up 
over here and 
we won't 
be able to get away. I'll be in touch. " The note was typed, 

322 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

blinchiki 

y . "Vodka? " 

with Mr. Booth' s name, also typed, at the 
bottom . Beth 
found one of the hotel 
restaurants
-another 
carpeted 
gymÂ­
nasium of a room-and managed 
enough Russian 
to order 
and tea with bl
ackberry 
jam . Her waiter 
was a 
serious-f
aced boy of about fourteen, and he served 
the little 
buckwheat 
cakes onto her plate and spread the melted 
butter 
and caviar 
and sour cream for her with a little 
silver 
spoon. 
Except for a group of older men in army officers' 
uniforms and two authorita
tive-looking 
men in three-piece 
suits, there was no one else in the restaurant. 
After a 
moment another 
young waiter 
came by with a 
pitcher 
of 
what looked like water on a silver 
tray, and a little 
shot 
glass beside 
it. He smiled 
at her pleasantl
She shook her head quickly. ' 'Nyet'' and poured herself 
a glass of water from the cut-glass pitcher 
in the center 
of 
the table. 
Her afternoon was free, and she 
could take a 
tour of 
Sverdlov 
Square and the Bely Gorod and the 
museum at 
St. Basil's, 
but even though it was a beautiful 
summer 
day, she didn't feel like it. Maybe in a day or two. She 
was tired, and she needed a nap. She had won her first 
game with a Russian 
grandmaster, 
and that was more 
important 
to her than anything 
she might see outside 
in the 
huge city that 
surrounded 
her. She 
would be here eight 
days. She could 
see Moscow another 
time. It was two in 
the afternoon when she finished 
lunch. She would take the 
elevator 
up to her room and try for 
a nap. 
She found she was too high 
from beating 
Laev to sleep. 
She lay on the huge 
soft bed staring 
at the ceiling 
for 
Â· 
nearly
an hour and 
played the game with 
him over and 
over, sometimes 
looking 
for weakness 
in the way she had 
played it, 
sometimes 
luxuriating over 
one or another 
of her 

323 

WALTER TEVIS 

moves. When she came to the place where she had offered 
him her bishop she would say zap! aloud, 
or pow! It was 
wonderful. She had made no 
mistakes--or 
could find none. 
There were no weaknesses. He'd had that nervous way 
of 
drumming 
his fingers 
on the table and scowling, 
but when 
he resigned 
he looked only 
distant 
and tired. 
Finally
, rested 
a bit, she got out of bed, put on jeans and 
her white T-shirt, 
and opened the heavy draperies 
at the 
window. Eight 
floors 
below was some kind of converÂ­
gence of boulevards with a few cars dotting 
their emptiÂ­
ness, and beyond the boulevards was a park dense with 
trees. She decided 
to take a walk. 
But when she was putting 
on her socks and 
shoes, 
she 
began to think about Duhamel, 
whom she would be playing 
White against 
tomorrow. She knew only two 
of his games, 
and they 
went back a few years . 
There were more recent 
ones in the magazines 
she had brought; 
she should 
go over 
them now. Then there was his game with Luchenko 
that 
was still 
in progress 
when she left. It would be printed up 
along with 
the other three and handed out tonight when 
the 
players met for an off
icial 
dinner 
here in the hotel. She had 
better 
do a few sit-ups 
and knee bends now and take a 
walk some other time. 
The dinner was a bore, but more than 
that, it was 
infuriating. Beth was seated 
at one end of the 
long table 
with Duhamel, Flento 
and Hellstrom; 
the Russian 
players 
were at the other end with their wives. Borgov sat at the 
head of the table 
with the woman Beth had seen him with 
at the Mexico City Zoo. 
The Russians 
laughed throughout 
the meal, drinking 
enormous 
quantities 
of tea and 
gesturÂ­
ing broadly, while their 
wives looked at them in adoring 
silence
. Even Laev, who had been so withdrawn 
at the 

324 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

tournament 
that morning, 
was ebullient. 
All of them seemed 
to be pointedly 
ignoring 
Beth's end of the table. 
She tried 
for a while to converse with Flento, 
but his 
English 
was 
poor and his fixed smile made her 
uncomfortable. After a 
few minutes 
of trying, she concentrated on her meal and 
did what she could to tune out the noise from the other end 
of the table. 
After dinner 
the tournament 
director 
handed out printed 
sheets 
with the day's games. In the elevator 
she started 
going through them, beginning 
with Borgov' s . The other 
two were draws, but Borgov had won his. Decisivel
y. 

The driver 
brought 
her to the hall by a different route the 
next morning, and this time she could see the huge crowd 
in the street outside 
waiting 
to get in, some of them with 
dark umbrellas 
against 
the morning drizz
le. He took her to 
the same side 
entrance 
she had 
used the day before. There 
were about twenty people standing 
there. When she got 
out and hurried 
past them into the building 
they applauded 
her. Someone 
shouted 
"Lisabeta Harmon! " j ust before the 
doorman closed 
the door behind her. 
On the ninth 
move Duhamel 
made an error in judgment, 
and Beth pounced 
on it, pinning 
his knight 
in front of a 
rook. It would 
cramp him for a moment 
while she got out 
her other bishop. She knew from studying 
his games that 
he was cautious 
and strong 
at defense; she had 
decided the 
night before to wait until she got a chance and then 
overwhelm 
him. By the fourteenth 
move she had 
both 
bishops 
aimed at his king, and on the eighteenth she had 
their diagonals 
opened. 
He hid from it, using his knights 
cleverly 
to hold her off, but she brought 
out her queen, 
and it became too much for him. His twentieth 
move was a 

325 

WALTER TEVIS 

hopeless try 
at warding 
her off. On the twenty-second 
he 
resigned. 
The game had taken barely 
an hour. 
They had played at 
the far end of the stage; 
Borgov, 
playing 
Flento, 
was at the near end . As she walked past 
him to the subdued 
applause 
the audience 
gave while 
games were in progress, he glanced up at her briefly. It 
was the first time since Mexico City that he 
had actually 
looked directly 
at her, and the look frightened 
her. 
On an impulse 
she waited 
for a moment just out of 
sight 
of the playing area 
and then came back to the edge of the 
curtain 
and looked across. Borgov' s seat was empty. Over 
at the other end he was standing, looking 
at the display 
board with 
the game Beth had 
just finished. 
He had one 
broad hand cupped over his jaw and 
the other in his coat 
pocket. 
He frowned as 
he studied 
the position
. Beth turned 
quickly 
and lef
t. 
After lunch, she walked across 
the boulevard and went 
down a narrow street 
to the park. The boulevard turned out 
to be Sokolniki 
Street, 
and there was a good deal of traffic 
on it when she crossed 
in a large crowd of pedestrian
s . 
Some o f 
the people 
looked at her and a few smiled, 
but no 
one spoke. The rain had ended and it was a pleasant day 
with the sun high in the sky and 
the enormous 
buildings 
that lined the street 
looking 
a little 
less prisonlike 
in the 
sunshine. 
The park was partly 
forested and had along its lanes a 
great many 
cast-iron benches 
with old 
people sitting 
on 
them. She 
walked along, 
ignoring 
the stares 
as best 
she 
could, going through 
some places that were dark with 
trees, and abruptly 
found herself 
in a large 
square with 
flowers growing in little triangles 
dotted 
here and there. 
Under a 
kind of roofed pavilion 
in the center, 
people 
were 

326 

THE QUEEN'S 
GAMBIT 

seated 
in rows. They were playing 
chess. There must have 
been forty boards going. 
She had seen old men playing 
in 
Central 
Park and Washington 
Square in New York, but 
only a few at any one time. Here it 
was a large crowd of 
men filling the bam-sized pavilion 
and spilling 
out onto 
the steps of it. 
She hesitated a 
moment at the worn marble stairs leadÂ­
ing up to the pavilion
. Two old men were playing 
on a 
battered 
cloth board on the steps. The older, 
toothless and 
bald, was playing 
King's Gambit. 
The other was using the 
Falkbeer 
Counter 
Gambit against 
it. It looked 
old-fashioned 
to Beth, but it was clearly 
a sophisticated game. The men 
ignored 
her, and she walked up the steps and into the 
shade of the 
pavilion 
itself. 
There were four rows 
of concrete tables 
with painted 
boards on their su
rfaces , and a pair of 
chess players
, all 
men, at each. Some kibitzers stood 
over the boar
ds. There 
was very little 
talk. From behind her came the occasional 
shouts of children, which sounded exactly the same 
in 
Russian 
as in any other language
. She walked slowly 
between 
two rows 
of games, smelling the 
strong 
tobacco 
smoke from the players
' pipes. Some of 
them looked up at 
her as she passed, 
and in a few faces she 
sensed 
recogniÂ­
tion, but no one spoke to her. They were all old-very 
old. Many of them must have seen the Revolution 
as boys. 
Generally 
their clothes 
were dark, even the cotton 
shirts 
they were wearing 
in the warm weather 
were gray; they 
looked like old 
men anywhere, like a multitude 
of incarnaÂ­
tions of Mr. Shaibel, playing 
out games that no one would 
ever pay attention 
to. On several 
tables 
lay copies of 

Shakhmatni 
v USSR. 

At one table where the position 
looked interesting, she 

327 

WALTER TEVIS 

stopped 
for a moment. 
It was the Richter-Rauzer, 
from the 
Sicilian
. She had written 
a small piece on it for Chess 
Review a few years bef
ore, when she was sixteen. 
The 
men were playing it 
right, 
and Black had a slight variation 
in his 
pawns that she had 
never seen 
before, but it was 
clearly 
sound. It was good chess. 
First-class chess, 
being 
played 
by two old men in cheap working 
clothes
. The man 
playing 
White moved his king's bishop, 
looked up at her 
and scowled. 
For a moment she felt powerfully selfÂ­
conscious 
among all 
these old Russian 
men with her nyÂ­
lons and pale-blue 
skirt and gray cashmere sweater, 
her 
hair cut and shaped in the proper 
way for a young AmeriÂ­
can girl, her feet in pumps that probably 
cost as 
much 
money as these men 
used to earn in a month. 
Then the wrinkled 
face of the man who was staring 
at 
her broke into a broad. gap-toothed 
smile, and said, "HarÂ­
mon? Elisabeta Harmon?" 
and, surprised, she said "Da. " 
Before she could react further, 
he stood u p and threw his 
arms around her 
and hugged her and laughed, 
repeating 
" Harmon! Harmon! " over and over. And then there was a 
crowd of old men in gray clothes 
around her smiling 
and 
eagerly 
holding 
out their 
hands for her to shake, 
eight or 
ten of them talking 
to her at once, in 
Russian. 

Her games with Hellstrom and Shapkin 
were rigorous, 
grim and 
exhausting, but she was 
never in 
any real danger. 
The work she had done over 
the past six months gave a 
solidity 
to her opening 
moves that 
she was able to 
maintain 
through 
the middle game and on to the point at which each 
of them resigned
. Hellstrom clearly 
took it hard and did 
not speak to her afterward, but Shapkin 
was a very civi-

328 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

Iized, very decent man, and he resigned 
gracefully even 
though her win over him was decisive 
and merciless. 
There would be seven games 
in all . The players had 
been given schedules during the 
long orientation 
speech 
on 
the first 
day; Beth kept hers in the nightstand 
by the bed , 
i n the drawer with her bottle 
o f green pills. O n the last day 
she would be playing the whites against 
Borgov. Today it 
was Luchenko, 
with black. 
Luchenko was the 
oldest 
player there; 
he had been 
World Champion 
before Beth was born, and played and 
defeated 
the great Alekhine 
in an exhibition 
when he was a 
boy, had drawn with Botvinnik 
and crushed 
Bronstein 
in 
Havana. 
He was no longer 
the tiger he 
had once been, but 
Beth knew 
him to be a dangerous 
player when allowed to 
attack. She had gone 
through 
dozens of his games from 
Chess Informant, some of them during the month with 
Benny in New York, and the power 
of his attack 
had been 
shocking, even to her. He was a formidable 
player 
and a 
formidable 
man. She would have to be very careful. 
They were at the first 
table-the one Borgov had played 
at the day before. Luchenko 
made a short bow, standing 
by his chair while she took her seat. His suit today was a 
silky gray, and when he 
walked up 
to the table she had 
noticed 
his shoes-shiny 
black and soft-looking, 
probably 
imported from Italy. 
Beth was wearing 
a dark-green 
cotton 
dress with white 
piping 
at the throat 
and sleeves
. She had slept soundly 
the 
night before. She was ready for him
. 
But on the twelfth move he 
began to 
attack-very 
subtly 
at first, with pawn to queen rook 
three. A half-hour 
later 
he was mounting 
a pawn storm 
down the queenside, 
and 
she had 
to delay what she was preparing 
to deal with it. 

329 

WALTER TEVIS 

What was he doing? 

She studied 
the board for 
a long time before bringing 
a 
knight over 
to defend
. She wasn't happy about doing 
it, 
but it had to be done. She looked across the board at 
Luchenko. He gave a Iitle 
shake of his 
head-a theatrical 
shake-and 
a tiny smile appeared 
on his lips. Then he 
reached 
out and continued 
the advance of 
his knight's 
pawn as if heedless 
of where she now had her 
knight. 
She studied the 
position 
again and 
then, shocked, she saw it. If she didn't find a way out, she 
would have to take the rook pawn with 
her knight, 
and 
four moves down from 
that he would be able to bring his 
innocent-looking 
bishop from the back rank out to knight 
five, there on her fractured 
queenside, 
and pick off her 
queen rook in exchange for it. 
It was seven moves away, 
and she hadn' t seen it. 
She leaned 
her elbows on the table and rested 
her cheeks 
against 
clenched 
fists. She had to work this out. She put 
Luchenko and 
the crowded 
auditorium 
and the ticking 
of 
her clock and everything 
else out of her mind and studied, 
going through 
dozens of continuations 
carefully. But there 
was nothing. 
The best she 
could do was give up the 
exchange 
and get his 
rook pawn as consolation. 
And he 
would still 
have his queenside 
attack 
going. She hated it, 
but it had to be done. 
She 
pushed up 
her queen rook pawn 
as she had 
to and watched 
the moves play themselves 
out. Seven moves later he got 
the rook for his bishop, 
and her stomach 
knotted 
when she 
saw him take 
up the piece in his hand and set it down at 
the side of 
the board. When she took the rook pawn two 
moves later it was no real help. She was 
behind in the 
game, and her whole body was tense. 
Just stopping 
the advance 
of his pawns down the queen-

She should have seen 
it coming. 

330 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

side was grim work. She 
had to 
return the pawn she had 
taken from him to manage it, and 
that done, he was douÂ­
bling his rooks on the king file. He wouldn't let up. She 
made a threat toward 
his king as a cover and managed to 
trade off one of his rooks for her remaining 
one. It did no 
good to trade when you were 
down, because 
it increased 
his advantage
, but she had to 
do it. Luchenko 
gave up the 
traded piece casually, and she 
looked at his snow-white 
hair as he took hers in 
exchange
, hating him for 
it. Hating 
him for his theatrical 
hair and hating 
him for being ahead 
of her by the exchange
. If they went on trading, she would 
be ground down to nothing. She had to find a way to stop 
him. 
The middle game was Byzantine. They were both enÂ­
trenched 
with every piece supported 
at least once and 
many of them twice. 
She fought 
to avoid trades 
and to find 
a wedge that could bring her back to even; 
he countered 
everything 
she attempted, moving his pieces 
surely 
with 
his beautifully 
manicured 
hand. The intervals 
between 
moves 
were long. Every now and then she would see a glimmer 
of a possibility 
way down the line, eight or ten moves 
away, but she was never able to make it materialize. 
He 
had brought 
his rook to the third rank and put it above his 
castled 
king; its movement 
was limited there to three 
squares. If she could 
only find a 
way to trap it before 
he 
lifted the knight 
that held it back. She concentrated on it as 
strongly 
as she knew how, feeling for a moment as though 
the intensity 
of her concentration 
might burn the rook off 
the board like a laser beam. She attacked 
it mentally 
with 
knights, 
pawns, the queen, even with her king. 
She menÂ­
tally forced him to raise a pawn so that it cut off two of the 
rook's flight 
squares, but 
she could find nothing .

WALTER TEVIS 

Feeling 
dizzy from 
the effort, she pulled 
her elbows off 
the table, 
put her arms in her lap, shook 
her head and 
looked at her 
clock. 
She had less than fifteen minutes. 
Alarmed, she looked down 
at her 
score sheet. 
She had to 
make three more moves before her flag fell or she would 
forfeit. Luchenko 
had forty minutes left 
on his clock. 
There was nothing 
to do but move. She 
had already 
conÂ­
sidered knight to knight five and knew it was sound, 
although 
of no particular 
help. She moved 
it. His reply 
was what she expected
, forcing her to bring the knight 
back to king four, where she had planned for it to be in the 
first place. 
She had seven minutes 
left. She studied 
careÂ­
fully and put her bishop on the diagonal 
that his rook sat 
on. He moved the rook, as she knew he would. She 
signaled 
the tournament 
director, 
wrote her next 
move on 
the score sheet, 
holding 
her other hand over it to hide it 
from Luchenko, 
and folded the sheet 
to seal it. When the 
director 
came over, she said, "Adjournment, " and waited 
for him to get the envelope. She 
was exhausted. There was 
no applause 
when she 
got up and walked wearily 
off the 
stage. 

It was a hot night and she had the 
window open in her 
room while she sat at the ornate writing 
desk with her 
chessboa
rd on it, studying 
the adjourned position, 
looking 
for ways to embarrass 
Luchenko's rook, or to use the 
rook's vulnerability 
as a cover for attacking 
him someÂ­
where else. After two hours of it, the heat in the room had 
become unbearable. She decided 
to go down to the lobby 
and then take a walk around the 
block-if that was safe 
and legal. She felt dizzy from too much chess 
and too 
little 
food. It would be nice to have a cheeseburger. 
She laughed 

332 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

wryly at herself; 
a cheeseburger 
was what an American 
of 
a type she thought 
she would never 
be craved when travelÂ­
ing abroad. God, was she tired! She would take a 
brief 
walk and come back to bed. She wouldn't be playing 
the 
adjournment 
out until tomorrow night; 
there would be 
more time for studying 
it after her game with 
Flento. 
The elevator 
was at the 
far end of the 
hall. Because 
of 
the heat, several 
rooms were open, and as she approached 
one of them she could hear deep male voices 
in some kind 
of discussion. When 
she was even with the doorway 
she 
looked inside. It must have been part 
of a suite because 
what she saw was a grand parlor with 
a crystal 
chandelier 
hanging 
from an 
elaborately 
molded ceiling, 
a pair of 
green overstuf
fed sofas and large, dark 
oil paintings 
on the 
far wall, where an open door led to a bedroom. There were 
three men in shirtsleeves 
standing 
around a table that sat 
between 
the couches. On the table was 
a crystal 
decanter 
and three shot glasses. 
In the center 
of the table was a 
chessboard; 
two of 
the men were watching 
and commentÂ­
ing while the third moved pieces 
around speculatively 
with 
his fingertips. The two men 
watching 
were Tigran Petrosian 
and Mikhail 
Tal. The one moving the pieces 
was Vasily 
Borgov . They were three of the best chess 
players in the 
world, and they 
were analyzing 
what must have been 
Borgov's adjourned position fr
om his game 
with Duhamel. 
Once as a child she had 
been on her way down the hall 
in the Administ
ration 
B uilding 
and had stopped 
for a 
moment by the door to Mrs. Deardorf
f's office, which was 
uncharacteristically open. Looking 
furtively inside, she 
had seen Mrs. Deardorff standing 
there in the outer 
office 
with an older man and a woman, involved 
in conversati
on, 
their heads 
together 
in an intimacy 
she would 
never have 

333 

WALTER TEVIS 

expected 
Mrs. Deardorff to be capable 
of. It had been a 
shock to peer into this adult world. Mrs. Deardor
ff held 
her index finger 
out and was tapping 
the lapel of the man 
with it as she 
talked, eye to eye, 
with him. Beth never saw 
the couple again and had 
no idea what they had been 
talking 
about, 
but she never forgot 
the scene. Seeing 
Borgov 
in the parlor of 
his suite, 
planning his next move with the 
help of Tal and 
Petrosian, she felt the same thing she had 
felt then. She felt inconseque
ntial-a child peering 
into the 
adult world. 
Who was she to presume? 
She needed 
help. 
She hurried 
past the room and to 
the elevator, 
feeling 
awkward and terribly alone. 

The crowd 
waiting 
by the side door had 
gotten bigger. 
When she stepped 
out of the limousine 
in the morning they 
began shouting 
"Harmon ! Harmon! " in unison 
and wavÂ­
ing and smiling
. A few reached 
out to touch her as she 
went by, and she pushed past them nervously, trying 
to 
smile back. 
She had slept only fitfully the night before, 
getting 
up from time to time to study the position 
of her 
adjourned game with 
Luchenko 
or to pace around 
the room 
barefoot, thinking of 
Borgov and the 
other two, neckties 
loosened 
and in shirtsleeve
s, studying 
the board as though 
tli.ey were Roosevelt, 
Churchill 
and Stalin 
with a chart of 
the final campaign 
of World 
War II. No matter 
how often 
she told herself 
she was 
as good as any of them, 
she felt 
with dismay that those men with their heavy 
black shoes 
knew something 
she did not know and never would know. 
She tried to concentrate 
on her own career, 
her quick rise 
to the top 
of American 
chess and beyond it, the way 
she 
had become a more powerful player 
than Benny Watts, 
the 
way she had beaten Laev without 
a moment of doubt in 

334 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

her moves, the way that, even 
as a child, she had found an 
error in the play of 
the great Morphy. But all of it was 
meaningless 
and trivial 
beside her glimpse 
into the esÂ­
tablishment 
of Russian chess, 
into the room 
where the men 
conferred 
in deep voices 
and studied the 
board with an 
assurance that seemed wholly 
beyond her. 
The one good thing was that 
her opponent 
was Flento, 
the weakest 
player in the tournament. 
He was already 
out 
of the running, with a clear loss and two draws. Only 
Beth, Borgov and Luchenko 
had neither 
lost nor drawn a 
game. She had a cup of tea before playing 
began, and it 
helped her a little. 
More important, 
just being in this room 
with the other players 
dispelled 
some of 
what she had been 
feeling during the night. 
Borgov was drinking 
tea when 
she came in. He ignored 
her as usual, and she ignored 
him, but he was not as frightening 
with a teacup in his 
hand and a quietly dull 
look on his heavy face as he had 
been in her imagination 
the night before. When the direcÂ­
tor came to escort 
them to the stage, 
Borgov glanced 
at her 
just before he left the room and raised 
his eyebrows 
slightly 
as if to say, "Here we go again! " and she found herself 
smiling 
faintly 
at him. She set down her cup and followed. 
She knew Flento' s erratic career very well and had 
memorized 
a dozen of his games. She had decided even 
before leaving 
Lexington 
that the thing to play 
against 
him, if 
she had the white pieces, would be the English 
Opening. She started 
it now , pushing 
the queen bishop 
pawn to the fourth rank. It was like the Sicilian 
in reverse. 
She felt comfortable with it. 
She won, but it took four and a half hours 
and was far 
more grueling 
than she had 
expected. He put up a fight 
along the two main diagonals 
and played the four-knights 

335 

WALTER TEVIS 

vanat10n 
with a sophisti
cation 
that was, for a while, 
far 
beyond her own. But when they got into the middle game, 
she saw an opportunity to 
trade her way out of the position 
and took it. She wound up doing a thing she had seldom 
done: nursing 
a pawn across 
the board until it arrived 
at 
the seventh 
rank. It would cost Flento 
his only remaining 
piece to remove it. He resigned
. The applause 
this time 
was louder than ever before. It was two-thirty. She had 
missed 
breakfast and was 
exhausted. 
She needed lunch 
and 
a nap. She needed to rest before the adjournment tonight. 
She ate a fast lunch of spinach 
quiche and a kind of 
S lavic pommes frites in the restauran
t. But when she 
went 
up to her room at three-thirty 
and got into 
bed, she found 
sleeping 
out of the question
. There was an intermittent 
hammering going 
on above her head, as though workmen 
were installing 
a new carpet. She could hear the clumping 
of boots, and every now and then it sounded 
as if someone 
had dropped 
a bowling 
ball from 
waist level. She lay in 
bed for twenty minutes, but it 
was no good. 
By the time she finished 
supper and arrived 
at the 
playing 
hall she was more tired than she ever remembered 
being. Her head ached and her body was sore from being 
hunched 
over a chessboard. She wished fervently that she 
could have been given a shot to knock her out 
for the 
afternoon, that she could face Luchenko 
with a few solid 
hours of dreamless sleep behind her. She wished she had 
risked 
taking a 
Librium . 
A little 
fuzz iri her mind would be 
better 
than this. 
When Luchenko 
came into the parlor 
room where the 
adjournment was to be played, 
he looked calm and rested. 
His suit, 
a dark 
worsted 
this time, was impeccably 
pressed 
and fit him beautif
ully across 
the shoulders
. It occurred to 

336 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

her that he must buy all his clothes 
abroad. He smiled at 
her with restrained 
politeness; 
she managed 
to nod and 
say 
"Good evening. " 
There were two tables 
set up for adjourned games. A 
classic rook-pawn 
ending was 
in place on one of them, 
waiting 
for Borgov and Duhamel. Her position 
with 
Luchenko 
had been laid out on 
the other. 
As she sat down 
at her end of it, Borgov and Duhamel came 
in together 
and 
walked to the board at the other side of 
the room in grim 
silence
. There was a referee 
for each game, and the clocks 
were already 
set up. Beth had her 
ninety 
minutes of 
overÂ­
time, and Luchenko had 
the same, along with an extra 
thirty-five 
minutes 
left from 
yesterday
. She had forgotten 
about his extra time. That put three things 
against 
her: his 
having the white pieces, his 
still 
unstopped 
attack, 
and his 
extra allotment of 
time. 
Their referee 
brought 
over the envelope, 
opened it, 
showed the score sheet to both players and made Beth' s 
move himself. 
He pressed 
the button 
that started 
Luchenko's 
clock, 
and without 
hesitation 
Luchenko advanced 
the pawn 
that Beth had expected. There was a certain 
relief 
in seeing 
him make the 
move. She 
had been forced to consider 
several 
other replies; 
now the lines from them could be 
dropped 
from her mind. 
Across the room 
she heard Borgov 
cough loudly 
and blow his nose. She tried to put Borgov 
out of her mind
. She would 
be playing 
him tomorrow, but 
it was time now to get to work on this game, to put 
everything 
she had into it. 
Borgov would almost 
certainly 
beat Duhamel 
and begin tomorrow 
undefeat
ed. If 
she wanted 
to win this tournament 
she had to 
rescue 
the game in 
front 
of her. Luchenko 
was ahead by the exchange, and that 
was 
bad. But he had that ineffective 
rook to contend 
with, and 

337 

WALTER TEVIS 

after several 
hours of study 
she had found three ways of 
using it against 
him. If she could bring it off, she could 
exchange 
a bishop 
for it and even the score. 
She forgot 
about how tired 
she was and went to work. It 
was uphill 
and intricate
. And Luchenko 
had that extra 
time. She decided 
on a plan developed 
in the middle of the 
night and began 
retreating 
her queenside 
knight, 
taking 
it 
on a virtual 
knight's tour to get it up to king five. Clearly 
he was ready for that-had 
analyzed 
it himself 
sometime 
since yesterday 
morning. Probably 
with assistance
. But 
there was something 
he might 
not have analyzed, 
good as 
he was, and that he might not see now. She pulled 
her 
bishop 
away from the diagonal 
his rook was on and hoped 
he wouldn' t see what she was 
planning
. It would appear 
that she was 
attacking 
his pawn formation, forcing him to 
make an unstable advan
ce. But she 
wasn't concerned with 
his pawn position. 
She wanted that rook off the board 
badly enough 
to kill for 
it. 
Luchenko 
merely pushed up the pawn. He could have 
thought 
longer 
about it-should 
have thought 
longer-but 
he didn't. He moved the 
pawn. Beth felt a tiny thrill. She 
took the knight 
off the diagonal 
and put it not on king five, 
but on queen bishop 
five, offering it to his queen. If his 
queen took it, she would 
take the rook for her bishop. 
That 
in itself 
would be no good for her-paying 
for the rook 
with the knight 
and the bishop-but what Luchenko 
hadn't 
seen was that she would get his 
knight 
in return 
because 
of 
the queen move. It was sweet. 
It was 
very sweet. She 
looked 
up hesitantly 
at him. 
She had not 
looked at him in almost an hour, and his 
appearance 
was a surprise. 
He had loosened 
his tie, and 
it 
was twisted 
to one side 
of his collar. 
His hair was mussed. 

338 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

He was biting 
his thumb and 
his face was shockingly 
drawn . 
H e gave 
i t a half-hour 
and found nothing. 
Finally 
he 
took the knight. 
She took the rook, wanting 
to shout with 
joy as it came off the 
board, and he took 
her bishop. Then 
she checked, he interpo
sed, and she pushed 
the pawn up to 
the knight. 
She looked at 
him again. The game would be 
even now . The elegant look 
was gone. He had become a 
rumpled old 
man in an expensive 
suit, and it suddenly 
occurred to her that she wasn't the only one exhausted by 
the games 
of the past six days. Luchenko 
was fifty-seven. 
She was nineteen. And 
she had 
worked out with Jolene 
for 
five months in Lexington. 
From that point on, the resistance 
left him. There was 
no clear positional 
reason why she should 
be able to hurry 
him to a resignation 
after taking his 
knight; 
it was a 
theoretically 
even game. His queenside pawns were 
strongly 
placed. 
But now she whittled 
away at 
the pawns, throwing 
subtle 
threats 
at them while attacking 
his remaining 
bishop 
and forcing him to protect 
the key 
pawn with his queen. 
When he did 
that, brought 
up his 
queen to hold his pawns 
together, 
she knew she had 
him. She focused her mind on 
his king, giving 
full attention 
to attack. 
There were twenty-f
ive minutes 
left on her clock and 
Luchenko 
still 
had nearly 
an hour, but she gave twenty of 
her minutes 
to working 
it out and then struck, bringing 
her 
king rook pawn up to the fourth rank. It was a clear 
announcement 
of her intention
s, and he gave it long
, hard 
thought 
before moving. She used 
the time his clock was 
ticking 
to work it all 
out--every variation 
on each of the 
moves he might make. She found an answer to anything 
he 
might do, and when he finally made his move, bringing 

339 

WALTER TEVIS 

his queen, wastefully, over to protect, she ignored 
the 
chance to grab one of his attacking 
pawns and 
advanced 
her king rook pawn another 
square. It was a splendid 
move, and she knew it. Her heart exulted 
with it. She 
looked across the board 
at him. 
He seemed lost in thought, 
as though 
he had been 
reading 
philosophy 
and had just set down the book to 
contemplate 
a difficult proposition. His face was gray 
now, with tiny wrinkles 
reticulating 
the dry skin. He bit 
his thumb again, and she saw, shocked, that his beautiful 
manicure 
of yesterday had been chewed ragged. 
He glanced 
over at her 
with a brief, 
weary glance-a glance 
with great 
weight of 
experience 
and a whole long career 
of chess in 
it-and back one final time at her rook pawn, now on the 
fifth rank. Then he stood up. 
"Excellent
! " he said, in English. 
"A beautiful 
recovery
!" 
His words were so concilia
tory that she was astonished. 
She was unsure 
what to say. 
"Excellent
! " he said again. He reached 
down and picked 
up his king, held it thoughtf
ully for a moment 
and set 
it on 
its side on the board. He smiled 
wearily. "I resign 
with 
relief.
' ' 
His naturalness 
and lack of 
rancor made her 
suddenly 
ashamed. She held out her hand to him, and he shook it 
warmly. "I've played games of yours ever 
since I was a 
small girl , " she said. "I've always admired 
you ." 
He looked at her thoughtfully 
for a moment. "You are 
nineteen?" 
" Yes . ' ' 
' ' I have gone over your games at this tournament
.' ' He 
paused. 
" You are a marvel , my dear. I may have just 
played 
the best chess player 
of my life.' ' 

340 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

She was unable 
to speak. She stared 
at him in disbelief. 
He smiled 
at her. "You will get used to it, " he said
. 
The game between 
Borgov and Duhamel had finished 
sometime 
earlier, and 
both men were gone. After Luchenko 
left she went 
over to the other board and looked at the 
pieces, which were still 
in position
. The blacks were 
huddled 
around their king in a vain attempt 
to protect, and 
the white artillery 
was coming 
at its comer 
from all over 
the board. The black king lay on its side. Borgov had been 
playing 
White. 
Back at the lobby of 
the hotel a 
man jumped up from 
one of the chairs 
along the wall and came smiling 
toward 
her. It was Mr. Booth. "Congratulations
! " he said. 
" What became of you?" she asked. 
He shook his 
head apologetical
ly. "Washingt
on. " 
She started 
to say something 
but let it pass. She was 
glad he 
hadn' t been bothering 
her. 
He had a folded 
newspaper 
under his arm. He pulled 
it 
out and 
handed it to her. It was Pravda. She couldn't 
penetrate 
the boldface Cyrillic 
of the headlines, but when 
she flipped it over, the bottom of page one had her picture 
on it, playing 
Flento. 
It filled 
three columns. She studied 
the caption 
for a moment and managed to 
translate 
it: 
"Surprising 
strength 
from the U . S . " 
" Nice, isn't it?" Booth said. 
" Wait till this time tomorrow, " she said. 

Luchenko 
was fifty-seven, 
but Borgov was thirty-
eight. 
Borgov was also known as an amateur 
soccer 
player 
and 
once held a collegia
te record for 
the javelin 
throw. He was 
said to exercise 
with weights 
during 
a tournament, using 
a 
gym that the government 
kept open late especially 
for him. 

341 

WALTER TEVIS 

He did not 
smoke or drink. 
He had been a master 
since the 
age of eleven. 
The alarming 
thing about playing 
over his 

games from Chess Informant and Shakhmatni 
v USSR was 

that he lost so few of them. 
But she had the white pieces. She must hang on to that 
advantage 
for dear life. She would play 
the Queen' s GamÂ­
bit. Benny 
and she had discussed 
that for hours, months 
before, and finally agreed that that was the way 
to go if 
she should 
get White against 
him. She did 
not want to play 
against 
Borgov's Sicilian
, much as she knew about 
the 
Sicilian, 
and the 
Queen's Gambit was 
the best way to 
avoid it. She could hold him off if she kept her head. The 
problem 
was that he didn't make mistakes. 
When she came across 
the stage to an auditorium 
more 
crowded than she 
believed 
possible, 
with every inch of the 
aisles 
filled and standees 
packed behind the back row of 
seats, and a hush fell over the enormous 
crowd of people 
and she looked over to see 
Borgov, 
already 
seated, waiting 
for her, she realized 
that it wasn' t only his remorseless 
chess that she had to 
contend 
with. She was terrified 
of the 
man. She had been terrified 
of him ever since she saw him 
at the gorilla 
cage in Mexico City. He was merely looking 
down at the untouched 
black pieces 
now, but her heart and 
breath stopped 
at the sight of him. There was no sign of 
weakness 
in that figure, motionless 
at the board, oblivious 
of her or of the thousands 
of other people who must be 
staring 
at him. He was like some menacing 
icon. He could 
have been painted 
on the wall of a cave. She walked 
slowly 
over and sat at the whites . A soft, hushed applause 
broke out in the audience. 
The referee 
pressed the 
button, 
and Beth heard her clock 
begin ticking. 
She moved pawn 
to queen four, 
looking 

342 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

down at the pieces. She was 
not ready to look at his face. 
Along the stage the other three games had started. She 
heard the movements 
of players behind her settling 
in for 
the morning's work, the click of clock buttons 
being pushed. 
Then everything 
was silent. 
Watching 
the board, she saw 
only the back of his hand, its stubby fingers 
with their 
coarse, black 
hair above the knuckles, 
as he moved his 
pawn to queen 
four. She played pawn to queen bishop 
four, offering the gambit pawn. The hand declined 
it, 
moving pawn to king four. The Albin Count
er Gambit. 
He 
was resurrecting 
an old 
response, but she 
knew the Albin. 
She took the pawn, glanced 
briefly 
at his face and glanced 
away. He played pawn to queen five. His face had been 
impassive 
and not quite as frightening 
as she 
had feared . 
She played 
her king's 
knight 
and he played his queen' s . 
The dance was i n progress . She felt small and lightweight. 
She felt like a little 
girl. But her mind was clear, 
and she 
knew the moves. 
His seventh 
move came as a surprise, and it was clear 
immediately 
that it was something 
he had saved to spring 
on her. She gave it twenty minutes, penetrated 
it as well as 
she could, and responded 
with a complete 
deviation 
from 
the Albin. She was glad to get out 
of it and into the open. 
They would fight it out 
from here with their wits. 
Borgov's wits, it turned 
out, were 
formidable. By the fourÂ­
teenth 
move he had equality 
and possibly 
an edge. She 
steeled 
herself, 
kept her eyes from his face, and played 
the best chess she knew, developing 
her pieces, defending 
everywhere
, watching 
every opportunity 
for an opened 
file, a clear diagonal
, a doubled 
pawn, a potential 
fork or 
pin or hurdle or skewer. 
This time she saw the whole 
board in her 
mind and caught 
every change 
of balance 
in 

343 

WALTER TEVIS 

the power that shifted over its 
surface 
.. Each 
particle 
of it 
was neutralized 
by its 
counterpar
ticle, 
but each was ready 
to discharge itself 
if allowed 
and break 
the structure 
open. 
If she let his rook out
, it would tear her apart. If he 
allowed 
her queen to move to the bishop file, his king's 
protection 
would topple. She 
must not permit 
his bishop 
to 
check. He 
could not allow her to 
raise the rook pawn. For 
hours she did not look 
at him or the audience 
or even the 
referee. In the whole of her mind
, in the whole 
of her 
attention 
she saw only those embodiments 
of danger-knight, 
bishop, rook, pawn, king and queen. 
It was Borgov who spoke the word ' 'Adjourn . ' ' He said 
it in English. She looked at her 
clock uncomprehendingly 
before she realized 
that neither 
flag had fallen and that 
Borgov' s was closer to it than hers. He had seven minutes 
left. She had fifteen. She looked at her 
score sheet. 
The 
last move 
was number forty. Borgov wanted to adjourn the 
game. She looked behind 
her; the rest of the stage was 
empty, the other games were over. 
Then she looked at Borgov. He had not loosened 
his tie 
or taken off his coat or rumpled his hair. He did not look 
tired. She turned away. The moment she saw that blank, 
quietly 
hostile 
face, she was terrified. 

Booth was in the lobby. 
This time 
he was with 
half a 
dozen reporters
. There was the man from The New York 
Times and the 
woman from the Daily Observer 
and the 
Reuters 
man and the UPI. There were two new faces 
among them as they came up to her in the lobby. 
' 'I'm tired as 
hel l , " she told Booth. 
"I bet you are , " he said. "But I promised 
these 
people . . . " He introduced 
the new 
ones. The first was from 

344 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

Paris-Match 

and the second from Time. She looked at the 
latter 
and said, "Will I be on the cover?" 
and he replied, 
"Are you going 
to beat him?" and she did 
not know how 
to answer. 
She was frighten
ed. Yet she was even on the 
board and somewhat 
ahead on time. She had not made any 
errors. But neither 
had Borgov. 
There were two photographers 
and she posed for picÂ­
tures with them, and when 
one of them asked 
if he could 
shoot her in front of a chess set she took them 
up to her 
room, where her board was still 
set up with the position 
from the Luchenko 
game. That already seemed 
a long time 
ago. She sat at the board for 
them, not really minding 
it-welcoming 
it, in fact-while 
they shot rolls 
of film 
from all over the room. It was like a party. While the 
photographers 
studied 
her and 
adjusted their cameras 
and 
switched 
lenses around, 
the reporters 
asked her questions
. 
She knew she should be setting 
up the position 
of her 
adjourned game and concentrating 
on it to find a strategy 
for tomorrow, but she welcomed 
this noisy 
distract
ion . 
Borgov would be in that suite of his now, probably 
with 
Petrosian 
and Tal-and maybe with Luchenko 
and Laev 
and the rest of the Russian 
establishment. 
Their expensive 
coats would 
be off and their sleeves 
rolled 
up and they 
would be exploring 
her position
, looking for weaknesses 
already 
there or ten moves down the line, probing 
at the 
arrangement 
of white pieces 
as though it were 
her body 
and they were 
surgeons 
ready to dissect. 
There was someÂ­
thing obscene 
in the image of them doing it. They 
would 
go on with it far into the 
night, 
eating 
supper over 
the 
board on that huge table in Borgov' s parlor, 
preparing 
him 
for the next 
morning. But she liked what she was doing 
right now. She did 
not want to think about 
the position. 

345 

WALTER TEVIS 

And she knew, too, 
that the position 
wasn't the problem. 
She could exhaust 
its possibilities 
in a few good hours 
after dinner. 
The problem 
was the way she felt about 
Borg.ov. It was good to forget that for a while. 
They asked about Methuen, and as always she was 
restrained
. But one of them pressed 
it a bit, and she found 
herself 
saying, "They stopped 
me from playing. 
It was a 
punishment, " and he picked 
up on that immediat
ely. It 
sounded 
Dickensian, 
he said. ' 'Why would they punish 
you like that?" Beth 
said, "I think they 
were cruel on 
principle
. At least the 
director 
was. Mrs . 
Helen Deardorff. 
Will you print that?' ï¿½ She was 
talking 
to the man from 
Time. He shrugged
. "That's for the legal department. If 
you win tomorrow, they might.' ' 
"They weren't all cruel, " she said. "T
here was a man 
named Fergussen, 
some kind of attendant. 
He loved us, I 
think.' ' 
The man from UPI who had interviewed 
her on her first 
day in Moscow spoke up. "Who taught 
you to play if they 
didn't want you doing 
it? ' ' 
" His name was Shaibel, " she said, thinking 
o f that wall 
of pictures 
in the basement. 
" William 
Shaibel. He was the 
janitor." 
"Tell us about it, " the woman from the Observer 
said. 
"We played chess in the basement, after he taught 
me 
how . ' ' 
Clearly 
they loved it. The man from Paris-Match 
shook 
his head, smiling. 
taught 
you to play chess?" 
"That's 
right, " Beth said, with an involuntary tremor in 
her voice. 
"Mr. William 
Shaibel. He was a damn good 
player. 
He spent a lot of time 
at it, and he was good. " 
After they left she took 
a warm bath, stretching 
out in 

"The janitor 

346 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

the enormous 
cast-iron tub. Then she put on her jeans and 
began setting 
up the pieces . But the minute she had it on 
the board and began to examine 
it, all the tightness 
came 
back. In Paris her position 
at this point 
had looked stronger 
than this, and she had lost. 
She turned from the desk and 
went to the window, 
opening 
the draperies 
and looking 
out 
on Moscow. The 
sun was stiJI high, 
and the city below 
looked far lighter and more cheerful than Moscow was 
supposed 
to look. The distant 
park where 
the old men 
played chess was 
bright 
with green, but she 
was frightÂ­
ened. She did not think she had 
the strength 
to go on and 
beat Vasily 
Borgov. 
She did not want to think 
about chess. 
If there had been a television 
set in her 
room, she would 
have turned it on. If she had had 
a bottle 
of anything, 
she 
would have 
drunk it. She thought 
briefly of calling 
room 
service 
and stopped herself 
just in time. 
She sighed 
and went back to 
the chessboard. It had to be 
studied
. She had to have a plan for tomorrow 
morning at 
ten. 

She awoke before 
dawn and 
lay in bed for a while before 
looking 
at her watch. It was five-thirty
. Two hours and a 
half. She had 
slept two hours and a half. She closed 
her 
eyes grimly and tried to get back to 
sleep. 
But it didn't 
work. The position 
of the adjourned game forced itself 
back into her mind. 
There were her pawns, and there was 
her queen. 
There was Borgov' s . She saw it, she could not 
stop seeing 
it, but it 
made no sense. She had stared 
at it 
for 
hours the night before, trying 
to get some kind 
of plan 
together 
for the rest of the game, moving the pieces 
around, 
sometimes 
on the real 
board and sometimes 
in her head, 
but it was no good. She could push the queen bishop 
pawn 

347 

WALTER TEVIS 

or bring the knight 
over to the kingside 
or put the queen on 
bishop 
two. Or on king two. If Borgov's sealed 
move was 
knight to bishop five. If he had moved 
his queen, the 
responses 
were different. If he was trying 
to make her 
analysis 
a waste, he might have played the 
king bishop. 
Five-th
irty. Four 
and a half hours 
until game time. Borgov 
would have his moves 
ready now and a game plan arrived 
at by consultation; 
he would be sleeping 
like a rock. From 
outside 
the window came a sudden noise like 
a distant 
alarm , and she jumped. It was just some Russian 
fire drill 
or something, 
but her hands shook for a moment. 
She had kasha and eggs 
for breakfast 
and sat down 
behind the board again. It was seven forty-five. But even 
with three cups of tea, she somehow could not penetrate 
it. 
She tried doggedly 
to get her mind 
to open, to let her 
imagination 
work for her the way it so often worked over a 
chessboard, 
but nothing 
came. She could see nothing 
but 
her responses 
to Borgov's future 
threats
. It was passive, 
and she knew it 
was passive. 
It had beaten her in Mexico 
City and it could beat her again. 
She got 
up to open the 
draperies, and as she turned back to the board, the teleÂ­
phone rang . 
She stared 
at it. During her week in this room, it 
had not 
rung once. Not even Mr. Booth had called 
her. Now it was 
ringing in 
short bursts, very loudly. She went 
over and 
picked 
it up. A woman's voice said 
something 
in Russian. 
She couldn't make out a word of it. 
"This is Beth Harmon, " she said. 
The voice said 
something 
else in Russian. 
There was a 
clicking in the receiver, 
and a male voice came through as 
clearly 
as if it were calling 
from the next room: " If he 
moves the knight, 
hit him with 
the king rook 
pawn. If he

THE QUEEN'S

goes for the king bishop, 
do the same. Then open up your 
queen file. This is costing 
me a bundle." 
she said. "Benny! How can you know . . . " 
"It's in the Times. It's afternoon 
here, and we've been 
working on 
it for three hours. Levertov's with me, and 
Wexler.' ' 
"Benny , " she said, "it's 
good to hear your voice. " 

"You've got to get that file open. Ther are four ways, 

depending 
on what he does. Do you have it handy?" 
She glanced toward the desk. "Yes . " 
"Let's start 
with his 
knight 
to B-5 where you push the 
king rook pawn. You 
got that?" 
"Yes . " 
' 'All right. 
There are three things 
he might do now. B to 
B-4 is first. If he does it, your queen pops 
right up to 
king four. He'll expect 
that but may 
not expect 
this: pawn 
to queen five.' ' 
" I don' t see . . . " 
"Look at his queen 
rook. " 
She closed 
her eyes and saw it. Only one of her 
pawns 
stood between 
her bishop and the rook. And if he tried to 
block the 
pawn, it made a hole for her knight. 
But Borgov 
and the others could 
not miss that. 
"He's got Tal and Petrosian helping 
him ." 
Benny whistled
. " I suppose he 
would, " he said. " But 
look further. If he moves 
the rook before your queen 
comes out, where's he going to put it?" 
"On the bishop file. " 
"You play pawn to queen bishop five and your file is 
almost 
open. ' ' 
He was right. 
It was beginning 
to look possible. 
' 'What 
if he doesn' t play B to B-4?" 

349 

WALTER TEVIS 

"I'll 
put Levertov 
on. " 
Levertov's voice came over the receiver. 
"He may play 
knight 
to B-5. That gets very tricky. I've got it worked 
out to where you pull ahead by a tempo. ' ' 
She had not 
cared for Levertov 
the one time she met 
him, but now 
she could 
have hugged him. "Give me the 
moves . ' ' 
He began reciting 
them. It was complicated, 
but she 
had 
no difficulty 
seeing 
the way 
it worked. 
"That' s beautif
ul, " she said. 
"I'll 
put Benny back on, " Levertov 
said. 
They went on together, exploring 
possibilities, 
follow" 
ing out line after line, for almost an hour. Benny 
was 
amazing. He had worked out everything; 
she began to see 
ways of crowding 
Borgov, finessing 
Borgov, 
deceiving 
him, tying up his pieces, 
forcing him to compromise 
and 
retreat. 
Finally 
she looked at her 
watch and said, " Benny, it' s 
nine-fifteen 
here.' ' 
"Okay , " he said
. "Go beat him ." 

There was a crowd 
outside 
the building. 
A display 
board 
had been erected 
above the front entrance for 
those who 
couldn't get into the auditorium; she 
recognized 
the posiÂ­
tion immediately 
from the car as it drove past. There in 
morning sunshine 
was the pawn 
she was going to advance, 
the file 
she was going to force open. 
The crowd by the side entrance 
was twice 
as big as 
yesterday
' s . They began chanting 
"Harmon ! Harmon! " 
before she opened the limousine 
door. Most of them 
were 
older people; 
several 
reached 
out smiling, 
fingers 
outÂ­
spread 
to touch her as she hurried 
past. 

350 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

There was only one table 
now, on center 
stage. Borgov 
was sitting 
at it when she came in. The referee 
walked 
with her to her 
chair, 
and when she was seated 
he opened 
the envelope 
and reached 
down to the board . He 
picked up 
Borgov' s knight 
and moved it to bishop five. It was the 
move she 
had wanted. She pushed her rook 
pawn one 
square forward. 
The next five moves followed 
a line that she and Benny 
had gone over 
on the telephone, 
and she got the file open. 
But on the sixth, 
Borgov brought 
his remaining 
rook to the 
center 
of the board and 
as she stared 
at it, sitting 
on his 
queen five, occupying 
a square that analysis 
had not foreÂ­
seen, she felt her stomach 
sink and knew that the call from 
Benny had only covered 
over the fear. She had been lucky 
for it to carry her this many moves. Borgov had started a 
line of play for which 
she had no continuation 
ready. She 
was alone 
again. 
She took her eyes 
from the board with an effort 
and 
looked out over the audience. She had been playing 
here 
for days and still 
the mere size of it was shocking. She 
turned uncertainly 
back to the board
, to the rook in the 
center. 
She had to do something 
about that rook. She 
closed 
her eyes. Immediately 
the game was visible 
to her 
imagination 
with the lucidity 
she had 
possessed 
as a child 
in bed at the 
orphanage
. She kept her eyes 
closed 
and 
examined 
the position 
minutely
. It was as complica
ted as 
anything 
she had ever played 
out from a book, and there 
was no printed 
analysis 
to show what the next move was 
or who would win. There were no backward 
pawns, no 
other weakn
esses, no clear-cut 
line of attack 
for either 
player. 
The material 
was even, but his rook could domiÂ­
nate the 
board like a tank on a field of cavalry. It sat on a 

351 

WALTER TEVIS 

black square, 
and her black bishop was gone. Her pawns 
could not attack it. 
It would take 
three moves to get a 
knight 
near enough. Her own rook was stuck in its home 
comer. She had one thing to meet it with: 
her queen. But 
where could she safely 
put her queen? 
She was leaning 
her cheeks on her 
fists now, and her 
eyes remained 
shut. The queen sat harmlessly 
on the back 
rank, on the queen bishop square, where it had sat since 
the ninth move. It 
could only go out by the diagonal, and 
it had three squares
. Each looked weak. She 
ignored the 
weakness 
and examined 
the squares sepa
rately, ending 
with king knight 
five. If the queen was there, he could 
swing his rook under it and occupy the file with 
a tempo. 
That would be catastr
ophic, unless 
she had a counterÂ­
move-a check or 
an attack 
on the black queen. But no 
check was possible 
except 
with her bishop, 
and that would 
be a sacrifice. His queen would merely take the bishop. 
But after that she could attack 
the queen with her knight. 
And where would he put it? 
It would have to go on one of 
those two dark 
squares. She began to see 
something. She 
could drive the queen into a king-queen 
fork with the 
knight. 
He would take 
her queen afterward, 
and she would 
still 
be down by that bishop. But her knight would 
now be 
poised for another 
fork. She would win his 
bishop. 
It 
would be 
no sacrifice. They would be equal aga
in, and her 
knight 
could go on to threaten 
the rook. 
She opened her eyes, blinked, and 
moved the queen. He 
brought 
the rook under it. Without 
hesitation 
she picked 
up 
her bishop, brought 
it out for the check, 
and waited 
for his 
queen to take it. He looked at it and did 
not move. For a 
moment she held her 
She closed 
her eyes again, frightened, and looked at the 

breath. Had she missed something

position
. He could move his king, instead 
of taking 
the 
bishop. 
He could interpose

Suddenly 
she heard his voice from across the table 
the astonishing 
word " Draw . " It was like a stateÂ­
saying 
ment and not a question. 
opened her eyes and looked at his face. Borgov never 
offered draws, but he was offering her one. 
She could 
accept 
it and the 
tournament 
would be over. They would 
stand up to be 
applauded 
and she would leave the stage in 
a tie with the 
champion 
of the world. Something went 
slack inside her, and 
she heard her own silent 
voice saying, 

He was offering her a draw. She 

Take it! 

She looked 
back at the board, at the real board that sat 
between 
them , and saw the 
endgame that was about to 
emerge when the dust settled
. Borgov was death on 
endgames; 
he was famous for it. She had always 
hated 
them-hated 
even reading 
Reuben Fine's book on endgames. 
She should 
accept 
the draw. People 
would call it a solid 
achievem
ent. 
A draw, however, 
was not a win. And the one thing in 
her life that she was sure she loved was a win. She looked 
at Borgov' s face again and saw with mild surprise 
that he 
was tired. She shook her head. No. 
He shrugged 
and took the bishop. 
For a brief moment 
she felt like a fool, but she shook it off and attacked 
his 
queen with her knight 
leaving 
her own en prise. He moved 
his queen where he had to and she brought 
the knight 
up 
for the fork. He moved the 
king and she lifted his heavy 
queen from the board . 
He took hers . She attacked 
the rook 
and he moved it back by a square. 
That had been 
the 
whole point 
of the sequence 
beginning 
with the bishopÂ­
cutting 
down the scope of the rook by forcing it to 
a less 

353 

WALTER TEVIS 

threatening 
rank-but now that it was there she was unsure 
what to do next. She had to be careful. They were headed 
toward a rook and pawn ending; 
there was no room for 
imprecision. For a moment she 
felt stuck, 
without 
imagiÂ­
nation 
or purpose 
and afraid 
of error. She closed 
her eyes 
again. There 
was an hour and a half on 
her clock; 
she had 
the time to do it and do it right. 
She did not open her eyes even to see 
the time remainÂ­
ing on her clock or to look across 
the table at Borgov or to 
see the enormous crowd 
who had come to this auditorium 
to watch her play. She let 
all of that go from her mind and 
allowed herself 
only the chessboa
rd of her imagination 
with its intricate 
deadlock. It did not really 
matter 
who was 
playing 
the black pieces 
or whether the 
material 
board sat 
in Moscow or New York or in the basement 
of an orphanÂ­
age; this eidetic 
image was her proper domain. 
She did 
not even hear the ticking 
of the clock. She held 
her mind in silence 
and let it move over the surface of the 
imagined 
board, combining 
and recombining 
the arrangements 
of pieces 
so the black ones 
could not stop the 
advance 
of 
the pawn she would choose. She saw now 
that it would be 
her king knight 
pawn, on the fourth rank. She moved it 
mentally 
to the fifth and surveyed 
the way the black king 
would advance 
to block it. The white knight 
would halt the 
king by threatening 
a key black pawn. If the white pawn 
stepped 
forward to the sixth rank its move must be preÂ­
pared for. It took a very 
long time to find the way, but she 
kept at it remorselessly. Her rook was the key, with a 
threatened 
hurdle-four moves in all-but the pawn could 
make the step. Now it had to move forward again. 
This 
was inchmeal, but the only way to do it. 
For a moment her mind became numb with weariness 

354 

THE QUEEN'S 

GAMBIT 

and the 
board unclear. 
She heard herself 
sigh as she forced 
it back to clarity
. First the pawn must be supported by the 
rook pawn, and to get the rook pawn up meant a diversion 
by sacrific
ing a pawn on the other side of 
the board. That 
would give Black a queen in three and cost White the rook 
to remove it. Then the white pawn, safe for 
a moment, 
slipped 
forward to the seventh 
rank, and when the black 
king sidled 
up to it, the 
white rook pawn came up to hold 
it in 
place. 
And now the 
final move, the advance 
to the 
eighth 
rank for promotion. 
She had come this 
far-these twelve moves 
from the 
position 
on the board that Borgov saw-by following hints 
and guesses and making them 
concrete in her 
mind. There 
was no question 
it could be 
done. But she saw no way to 
move the pawn that final squ
are without having 
the black 
king snip it off just before queening, 
like an unbloomed 
flower. 
The pawn looked heavy and impossible 
to move. 
She could not budge it. She had got it this far and there 
was no way to go further. It was hopeless. She had made 
the strongest 
mental effort of her life, 
and it was a waste. 
The pawn could not queen. 
She leaned 
wearily 
back in her chair with 
her eyes still 
closed and 
let the screen of her mind go dark for a 
moment. Then she brought 
it back 
for a final 
look. And 
this time with 
a start she saw it. He had used his bishop 
for 
taking 
her rook and now it 
could not stop her knight. 
king aside. The white pawn 
would 
queen, and 
check would follow in four moves. Mate in 
nineteen. 
She opened her eyes and squinted 
for a moment 
at the 
brightness 
of the stage before looking 
at her clock. 
She 
had twelve 
minutes 
left. Her eyes had been closed 
for over

had made 
an error, there would 
be no time 
for a new strategy
. She reached 
forward and moved

king knight 
pawn to the fifth rank. There was a stab of 
pain in her shoulder 
as she set it down; her muscles 
felt 
rigid. 
Borgov advanced 
his king to stop the pawn. She adÂ­
vanced the knight, 
forcing him to protect. 
It was going the 
way she had 
seen it would go. 
The tightness 
of her body 
began to loosen, and over the next moves there began to 
spread through 
her a fine sense of calm. She moved the 
pieces with 
deliberate speed, punching 
the clock firmly 
after each, and gradually 
Borgov's responses 
began to 
slow. He was taking 
more time between 
moves now
. She 
could see uncertainty 
in the hand that 
picked 
up the pieï¿½es. 
When the threatened 
hurdle 
was done with 
and she inched 
the pawn to the sixth rank, she watched 
his face. His 
expression 
did not change but he 
reached 
up and ran 
his 
fingers 
through 
his hair, ruffling 
it. A thrill 
passed through 
her body
. 
When she advanced 
the pawn to the seventh 
rank, she 
heard a 
soft grunt from him as though 
she had punched 
him in the stomach . It took him a long time to bring the 
king over 
to block it. 
She waited 
just a moment 
before letting 
her hand move 
out over 
the board. When she picked up the knight the 
sense of its power in her fingertips 
was exquisite
. She did 
not look at Borgov. 
When she set the 
knight down, there was complete 
silence. 
After a moment she heard a letting-out 
of breath 
from across 
the table and looked up. Borgov's hair was 
rumpled 
and there was a grim smile on his face. He spoke 
in English. "It's your game. " He pushed back his chair,

GAMBIT 

stood up, and then reached 
down and picked up his king. 
Instead 
of setting 
it on its side he 
held it across 
the board 
to her. She 
stared at 
it. "Take it, " he said
. 
The applause 
began. She took the black king in her hand 
and turned to face the auditor
ium, letting 
the whole masÂ­
sive weight of the ovation 
wash over her. People in the 
audience 
were standing, applauding 
louder 
and louder. 
She 
received 
it with her whole body, 
feeling her cheeks redden 
with it and then go hot 
and wet as the thunderous 
sound 
washed away 
thought. 
And then Vasily 
Borgov was standing 
beside 
her, and a 
moment later to her complete 
astonishment he 
had his 
arms spread and then 
was embracing 
her, hugging 
her to 
him warmly. 

During the party at the embassy, a waiter 
came by with a 
tray of champagne
. She shook her head. Everyone 
else 
was drinking and 
sometimes 
toasting 
her. During the 
five 
minutes 
the ambassador 
himself 
had been there, he offered 
her champagne 
and she took club soda. She ate some black 
bread with caviar and 
answered 
questions. There were 
over a dozen reporters 
and several 
Russians. 
Luchenko 
was there, 
looking 
beautiful 
again, but she was disapÂ­
pointed 
Borgov hadn't come. 
It was still 
midaftemoon, and she had not had lunch. 
She felt weightless 
and tired, 
somehow disembodied
. She 
had never liked 
parties 
and even though she 
was the star of 
this one, she felt out of place. 
Some of the people 
from the 
embassy 
looked at her 
strangely, 
as though she 
were an 
oddity. They kept telling 
her that they weren't clever 
enough to play chess or that they had played chess when 
they were 
kids. She didn' t want to hear any more of that.

WALTER TEVIS 

She wanted to do something 
else. She wasn' t sure what it 
was, but she wanted to be away from 
these people. 
She pushed through 
the crowd and thanked 
the woman 
from Texas 
who was acting 
as hostess . Then she told Mr. 
Booth she needed a ride back to 
the hotel. 
' T ll get a car and driver," he said. 
Before leaving, she found Luchenko 
again. He was 
standing 
with the other Russians, 
dressed 
impeccably 
and 
looking 
at ease. She held out her hand. " It was an honor 
to play you, " she said
. 
He took 
the hand and bowed slightly
. For a moment 
she 
thought 
he might kiss it, but 
he did not. He pressed 
her 
hand with 
both of his. "All this, " he said. "It's not like 
chess at all. ' ' 
She smiled. 
"That's right. " 

The embassy 
was on Ulitsa 
Tchaikovsko
go, and it was a 
half-hour drive, some of 
it through 
dense traffic, to her 
hotel. She had seen almost nothing 
of Moscow, and she 
would be leaving 
in the morning, but she did not feel like 
looking out 
the windows. They had 
given her the trophy 
and the money after the game. She had done her interÂ­
views, had received 
her congratu
lations. Now she felt at 
loose ends, uncertain 
where to go or what to do. Maybe 
she could sleep for 
a while, eat a quiet supper 
and go to 
bed early. She had beaten them. She had beaten the RusÂ­
sian establishm
ent , had beaten Luchenko, Shapkin 
and 
Laev, had forced Borgov to resign. 
In two years 
she could 
be playing 
Borgov for the World Championship. 
She had 
to qualify first by winning 
the candidates 
match, but she 
could win it. A neutral place would 
be chosen, and she 
would meet Borgov, head to 
head, for 
a twenty-f
our-game 

358 

THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT 

match. She would be twenty-one 
then. She did not want to 
think about it now. She closed her 
eyes and dozed in 
the 
back of the limousine. 
When she looked out, sleepily, they were stopped 
at a 
traffic 
signal. Up ahead, 
to the right, 
was the forested 
park 
that was visible 
from her room. She shook herself 
awake 
and leaned forward to the driver. 
"Let me off at the 
park. '' 
Sunlight filtered 
through 
the trees on her. The people 
on 
the benches seemed 
to be the same people as 
before. It did 
not matter whether 
they knew who 
she was or not. She 
walked past them along the path 
into the clearing. 
Nobody 
was looking 
at her. She came to the pavilion 
and walked 
up the steps. 
About halfway 
down the first row of concrete tables 
an 
old man was sitting 
alone with the pieces 
set up in front of 
him. He was in his sixties 
and wore the usual gray cap and 
gray cotton shirt with the sleeves 
rolled 
up. When she 
stopped 
at his table he looked 
at her inquisitivel
y , but there 
was no recognition 
on his face. She sat behind the black 
pieces 
and said carefully in Russian, 
"Would you like to 
play chess?''
